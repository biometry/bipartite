  abstract      = {Spatial models for habitat selection of marsh-breeding bird species were developed using artificial neural networks. The habitat models included single and multiple species artificial neural networks for red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) and marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris). Data for the study came from two diked wetland basins on southwestern Lake Erie, USA. The single species artificial neural network model performed better than the logistic regression model except in the presence of interspecific interaction with marsh wren. A multiple species habitat model was developed using data from one basin that included both nesting red-winged blackbirds and marsh wrens. The multiple species neural network model performed better than the logistic regression model in the presence of interspecific interaction and could simultaneously predict the nest locations of both species. Using neural interpretation diagrams, relevances, and sensitivity analyses, we determined the mechanisms of habitat selection in red-winged blackbirds and marsh wrens. Habitat selection in marsh-breeding bird species was a non-linear process that could not be sufficiently understood in terms of general linear models. The non-linear structure of the neural network model not only predicts habitat selection better, but with a critical evaluation through neural interpretation diagrams, relevances and sensitivity analyses can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of habitat selection. As predictive tools single species neural network models were too specific in cases where the system changed to include interacting species. In these cases linear models might be better predictors but not necessarily provide a better understanding. In the presence of two interacting species we suggest the use of a neural network model that is trained with a data set from a wetland where all the interacting species are present. In the absence of the interacting species the dynamics will change and habitat selection can be based on an entirely different set of rules and relationships. Therefore, the decision on which neural network model to use must be based on an in-depth understanding of the ecology of the system under study.},

  Abstract                 = {The loss and fragmentation of natural habitats by human activities are pervasive phenomena in terrestrial ecosystems across the Earth and the main driving forces behind current biodiversity loss. Animal-mediated pollination is a key process for the sexual reproduction of most extant flowering plants, and the one most consistently studied in the context of habitat fragmentation. By means of a meta-analysis we quantitatively reviewed the results from independent fragmentation studies throughout the last two decades, with the aim of testing whether pollination and reproduction of plant species may be differentially susceptible to habitat fragmentation depending on certain reproductive traits that typify the relationship with and the degree of dependence on their pollinators. We found an overall large and negative effect of fragmentation on pollination and on plant reproduction. The compatibility system of plants, which reflects the degree of dependence on pollinator mutualism, was the only reproductive trait that explained the differences among the species effect sizes. Furthermore, a highly significant correlation between the effect sizes of fragmentation on pollination and reproductive success suggests that the most proximate cause of reproductive impairment in fragmented habitats may be pollination limitation. We discuss the conservation implications of these findings and give some suggestions for future research into this area.},

  Abstract                 = {Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms and human society. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities: groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes or social spheres. Communities in networks often overlap such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic networks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.},

  Abstractnote             = {Plant-animal mutualisms are characterized by weak or asymmetric mutual dependences between interacting species, a feature that could increase community stability. If invasive species integrate into mutualistic webs, they may alter web structure, with consequences for species persistence. However, the effect of alien mutualists on the architecture of plant-pollinator webs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the extent of mutual dependency between interacting species, as a measure of mutualism strength, and the connectivity of 10 paired plant-pollinator webs, eight from forests of the southern Andes and two from oceanic islands, with different incidences of alien species. Highly invaded webs exhibited weaker mutualism than less-invaded webs. This potential increase in network stability was the result of a disproportionate increase in the importance and participation of alien species in the most asymmetric interactions. The integration of alien mutualists did not alter overall network connectivity, but links were transferred from generalist native species to super-generalist alien species during invasion. Therefore, connectivity among native species declined in highly invaded webs. These modifications in the structure of pollination webs, due to dominance of alien mutualists, can leave many native species subject to novel ecological and evolutionary dynamics.},

Noticeably rare, however, are attempts to quantify temporal variation in the structure of plant2013pollinator networks, and to determine whether the status of species as specialists or generalists is stable. Here we show that network structure varied through time in a montane meadow community from southern California, USA, in that pollinator species did not form the same links with plant species across years. Furthermore, composition of the generalized core group of species in the network varied among summers, as did the identity of those species involved in relationships that appeared to be reciprocally specialized within any one summer. These differences appear to be related to severe drought conditions experienced in the second summer of the 3 year study. In contrast to this variation, the pollinator community remained similarly highly nested in all three summers, even though species were packed into the nested matrix differently from year to year. These results suggest that plant2013pollinator networks vary in detail through time, while retaining some basic topological properties. This dynamic aspect of community-scale interactions has implications for both ecological and evolutionary inferences about pollination mutualisms.},

It underlies classifications in evolution and ecology, including those used to describe phylogenetic levels, the habitat and functional roles of organisms in ecosystems. Surprisingly, this concept is not explicitly included in simple models for the structure of food webs, the ecological networks formed by consumer-resource interactions. We present here the simplest possible model based on groups, and show that it performs substantially better than current models at predicting the structure of large food webs. Our group-based model can be applied to different types of biological and non-biological networks, and for the first time merges in the same framework two important notions in network theory: that of compartments (sets of highly interacting nodes) and that of roles (sets of nodes that have similar interaction patterns). This model provides a basis to examine the significance of groups in biological networks and to develop more accurate models for ecological network structure. It is especially relevant at a time when a new generation of empirical data is providing increasingly large food webs.},

  abstract =      {Forty years ago, May proved that sufficiently large or complex ecological networks have a probability of persisting that is close to zero, contrary to previous expectations. May analysed large networks in which species interact at random. However, in natural systems pairs of species have well-defined interactions (for example predator-prey, mutualistic or competitive). Here we extend May's results to these relationships and find remarkable differences between predator-prey interactions, which are stabilizing, and mutualistic and competitive interactions, which are destabilizing. We provide analytic stability criteria for all cases. We use the criteria to prove that, counterintuitively, the probability of stability for predator-prey networks decreases when a realistic food web structure is imposed or if there is a large preponderance of weak interactions. Similarly, stability is negatively affected by nestedness in bipartite mutualistic networks. These results are found by separating the contribution of network structure and interaction strengths to stability. Stable predator-prey networks can be arbitrarily large and complex, provided that predator-prey pairs are tightly coupled. The stability criteria are widely applicable, because they hold for any system of differential equations.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of nested structures in sets of species assemblages across different sites or in networks of interspecific interactions has become common practice in ecological studies. Although new analyses and metrics have been proposed, few studies have scrutinized the concepts that subtend nestedness analysis. We note two important conceptual problems that can lead to terminological inconsistencies and flawed interpretations. First, the thermodynamic analogy that underlies the most common metric of nestedness, matrix temperature, is flawed and has led some authors to incorrect interpretations. Second, the term ‚Äò‚Äòanti-nestedness‚Äô‚Äô is a potential source of confusion and inconsistencies. We review four concepts for anti-nestedness and examine how distinct they are. ‚Äò‚ÄòAnti-nested‚Äô‚Äô matrices, i.e. less nested than expected by chance, may result from different ecological processes and show distinct structural patterns. Thus, there is no single unequivocal opposite of nestedness to be represented as ‚Äò‚Äòanti-nestedness‚Äô‚Äô. A more profitable approach is to designate and test each distinct non-nested pattern according to its specific assumptions and mechanistic hypotheses.},

We show that functional extinction of bird pollinators has reduced pollination, seed production, and plant density in the shrub Rhabdothamnus solandri (Gesneriaceae) on the North Island ("mainland") of New Zealand but not on three nearby island bird sanctuaries where birds remain abundant. Pollen limitation of fruit set is strong (Pollen Limitation Index = 0.69) and significant on the mainland but small (PLI = 0.15) and nonsignificant on islands. Seed production per flower on the mainland is reduced 84{\%}. Mainland sites have similar adult densities, but 55{\%} fewer juvenile plants per adult, than island sites. Seed addition experiments near adult R. solandri plants on the mainland found strong seed limitation 5 years after sowing for R. solandri but not for two other co-occurring woody species. This demonstrates a terrestrial trophic cascade.},

  abstract      = {Ecological interaction networks are a valuable approach to understanding plant-pollinator interactions at the community level. Highly structured daily activity patterns are a feature of the biology of many flower visitors, particularly provisioning female bees, which often visit different floral sources at different times. Such temporal structure implies that presence/absence and relative abundance of specific flower-visitor interactions (links) in interaction networks may be highly sensitive to the daily timing of data collection. Further, relative timing of interactions is central to their possible role in competition or facilitation of seed set among coflowering plants sharing pollinators. To date, however, no study has examined the network impacts of daily temporal variation in visitor activity at a community scale. Here we use temporally structured sampling to examine the consequences of daily activity patterns upon network properties using fully quantified flower-visitor interaction data for a Kenyan savanna habitat. Interactions were sampled at four sequential three-hour time intervals between 06:00 and 18:00, across multiple seasonal time points for two sampling sites. In all data sets the richness and relative abundance of links depended critically on when during the day visitation was observed. Permutation-based null modeling revealed significant temporal structure across daily time intervals at three of the four seasonal time points, driven primarily by patterns in bee activity. This sensitivity of network structure shows the need to consider daily time in network sampling design, both to maximize the probability of sampling links relevant to plant reproductive success and to facilitate appropriate interpretation of interspecific relationships. Our data also suggest that daily structuring at a community level could reduce indirect competitive interactions when coflowering plants share pollinators, as is commonly observed during flowering in highly seasonal habitats.},

Much attention has been given to the control of water levels in the ditch systems within these wet grassland systems. In this paper we report measurements of aeration status and water-table fluctuation made on a peat soil site at Tadham Moor in Somerset, UK, where water management has focused on the maintenance of wet conditions that oftenresult inflooding inwinterandwet soil conditions inthe spring and summer. Measurement and modelling of the water-table fluctuation indicates the possibility of variability in the aeration of the root environment and anoxic conditions for much of the winter period and for part of the spring and summer. We have used water content and redox potential measurements to characterize the aeration status of the peat soil. We find that air-filled porosity is related to water-table depth in these situations. Redox potentials in the spring were generally found to be low, implying a reducing condition for nitrate and iron. A significant relationship (p< 0Ð01) between redox potential and water-table depth exists for data measured at 0Ð1m depth, but no relationship could be found for data from 0Ð4m depth.},

  Abstract                 = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of mutualistic networks has become a central tool in answering theoretical and applied questions regarding our understanding of ecological processes. Significant gaps in knowledge do however need to be bridged in order to effectively and accurately be able to describe networks. Main concern are the incorporation of species level information, accounting for sampling limitations and understanding linkage rules. Here I propose a simple method to combine plant pollinator effort-limited sampling with information about plant community to gain understanding of what drives linkage rules, while accounting for possible undetected linkages. I use hierarchical models to estimate the probability of detection of each plant-pollinator interaction in 12 Mediterranean plant-pollinator networks. As it is possible to incorporate plant traits as co-variables in the models, this method has the potential to be used for predictive purposes, such as identifying undetected links among existing species, as well as potential interactions with new plant species. Results show that pollinator detectability is very skewed and usually low. Nevertheless, 84{\%} of the models are enhanced by the inclusion of co-variables, with flower abundance and inflorescence type being the most commonly retained co-variables. The predicted networks increase network Connectance by 13{\%}, but not Nestedness, which is known to be robust to sampling effects. However, 46{\%} of the pollinator interactions in the studied networks comprised a single observation and hence could not be modeled. The hierarchical modeling approach suggested here is highly flexible and can be used on binary or frequency networks, accommodate different observers or include collection day weather variables as confounding factors. An R script is provided for a rapid adoption of this method.},

  Abstract                 = {The structural organization of mutualism networks, typified by interspecific positive interactions, is important to maintain community diversity. However, there is little information available about the effect of introduced species on the structure of such networks. We compared uninvaded and invaded ecological communities, to examine how two species of invasive plants with large and showy flowers (Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis and Opuntia stricta) affect the structure of Mediterranean plant-pollinator networks. To attribute differences in pollination to the direct presence of the invasive species, areas were surveyed that contained similar native plant species cover, diversity and floral composition, with or without the invaders. Both invasive plant species received significantly more pollinator visits than any native species and invaders interacted strongly with pollinators. Overall, the pollinator community richness was similar in invaded and uninvaded plots, and only a few generalist pollinators visited invasive species exclusively. Invasive plants acted as pollination super generalists. The two species studied were visited by 43{\%} and 31{\%} of the total insect taxa in the community, respectively, suggesting they play a central role in the plant-pollinator networks. Carpobrotus and Opuntia had contrasting effects on pollinator visitation rates to native plants: Carpobrotus facilitated the visit of pollinators to native species, whereas Opuntia competed for pollinators with native species, increasing the nestedness of the plant-pollinator network. These results indicate that the introduction of a new species to a community can have important consequences for the structure of the plant-pollinator network.},

There is almost no information on the structural organization of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the organization and persistence of biodiversity.},

  Abstract                 = {The main theories of biodiversity either neglect species interactions or assume that species interact randomly with each other. However, recent empirical work has revealed that ecological networks are highly structured, and the lack of a theory that takes into account the structure of interactions precludes further assessment of the implications of such network patterns for biodiversity. Here we use a combination of analytical and empirical approaches to quantify the influence of network architecture on the number of coexisting species. As a case study we consider mutualistic networks between plants and their animal pollinators or seed dispersers. These networks have been found to be highly nested, with the more specialist species interacting only with proper subsets of the species that interact with the more generalist. We show that nestedness reduces effective interspecific competition and enhances the number of coexisting species. Furthermore, we show that a nested network will naturally emerge if new species are more likely to enter the community where they have minimal competitive load. Nested networks seem to occur in many biological and social contexts, suggesting that our results are relevant in a wide range of fields.},

Identifying communities of nodes that tend to interact more with each other than the network as a whole is a key research focus across multiple disciplines, yet many community detection algorithms only use information about the presence or absence of interactions between nodes. Weighted modularity is a potential method for evaluating the quality of community partitions in quantitative networks. In this framework, the optimal community partition of a network can be found by searching for the partition that maximizes modularity. Attempting to find the partition that maximizes modularity is a computationally hard problem requiring the use of algorithms. QuanBiMo is an algorithm that has been proposed to maximize weighted modularity in bipartite networks. This paper introduces two new algorithms, LPAwb+ and DIRTLPAwb+, for maximizing weighted modularity in bipartite networks. LPAwb+ and DIRTLPAwb+ robustly identify partitions with high modularity scores. DIRTLPAwb+ consistently matched or outperformed QuanBiMo, while the speed of LPAwb+ makes it an attractive choice for detecting the modularity of larger networks. Searching for modules using weighted data (rather than binary data) provides a different and potentially insightful method for evaluating network partitions.},

  Abstractnote             = {Plant-pollinator networks are systems of outstanding ecological and economic importance. A particularly intriguing aspect of these systems is their high diversity. However, earlier studies have concluded that the specific mechanisms of plant-pollinator interactions are destabilizing and should lead to a loss of diversity. Here we present a mechanistic model of plant and pollinator population dynamics with the ability to represent a broad spectrum of interaction structures. Using this model, we examined the influence of pollinators on the stability of a plant community and the relationship between pollinator specialization and stability. In accordance with earlier work, our results show that plant-pollinator interactions may severely destabilize plant coexistence, regardless of the degree of pollinator specialization. However, if plant niche differentiation, a classical stabilizing mechanism, is sufficiently strong to overcome the minority disadvantage with respect to pollination, interactions with pollinators may even increase the stability of a plant community. In addition to plant niche differentiation, the relationship between specialization and stability depends on a number of parameters that affect pollinator growth rates. Our results highlight the complex effects of this particular type of mutualism on community stability and call for further investigations of the mechanisms of diversity maintenance in plant-pollinator systems.},

  Abstractnote             = {1. Recent efforts to understand how the patterning of interaction strength affects both structure and dynamics in food webs have highlighted several obstacles to productive synthesis. Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory. 2. Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term “interaction strength”. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field. 3. Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits. 4. Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchangeable with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity. 5. Finally, the prime focus on predator-prey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of non-trophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community. Such interactions may be important dynamically and should be routinely included in future food web research programmes.},

  abstractnote = {This paper examines whether clique-structure in cognitive data (i.e. recall of who one talks to) may be used as a proxy for clique-structure in behavioral data (i.e. who one actually talks to). The answer to this question is crucial to much of sociometric and social net-theoretic studies of social structure. We analysed the clique structures of the communication patterns of four naturally occurring groups of sizes 34 to 58, whose actual communications could easily be monitored, together with the groups’ perceptions of their communications. The groups used were: radio hams, a college fraternity, a group of office workers, and an academic department. The analysis used clique-finding, block-modelling, and factor-analytic techniques, all employed in such a way as to maximize the accuracy of the cognitive data. After defining a way to compare clique structures between behavioral and cognitive data, we found that there was no useful relationship between the two, and furthermore there was no significant difference in performance between any of the structure-finding algorithms. We conclude that cognitive data may not be used for drawing any conclusions about behavioral social structure. © 1979.},

  Abstract                 = {The structure of ecological interaction networks is often interpreted as a product of meaningful ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that shape the degree of specialization in community associations. However, here we show that both unweighted network metrics (connectance, nestedness, and degree distribution) and weighted network metrics (interaction evenness, interaction strength asymmetry) are strongly constrained and biased by the number of observations. Rarely observed species are inevitably regarded as ‚Äúspecialists,‚Äù irrespective of their actual associations, leading to biased estimates of specialization. Consequently, a skewed distribution of species observation records (such as the lognormal), combined with a relatively low sampling density typical for ecological data, already generates a ‚Äúnested‚Äù and poorly ‚Äúconnected‚Äù network with ‚Äúasymmetric interaction strengths‚Äù when interactions are neutral. This is confirmed by null model simulations of bipartite networks, assuming that partners associate randomly in the absence of any specialization and any variation in the correspondence of biological traits between associated species (trait matching). Variation in the skewness of the frequency distribution fundamentally changes the outcome of network metrics. Therefore, interpretation of network metrics in terms of fundamental specialization and trait matching requires an appropriate control for such severe constraints imposed by information deficits. When using an alternative approach that controls for these effects, most natural networks of mutualistic or antagonistic systems show a significantly higher degree of reciprocal specialization (exclusiveness) than expected under neutral conditions. A higher exclusiveness is coherent with a tighter coevolution and suggests a lower ecological redundancy than implied by nested networks.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Network analyses of plant-animal interactions hold valuable biological information. They are often used to quantify the degree of specialization between partners, but usually based on qualitative indices such as 'connectance' or number of links. These measures ignore interaction frequencies or sampling intensity, and strongly depend on network size.RESULTS:Here we introduce two quantitative indices using interaction frequencies to describe the degree of specialization, based on information theory. The first measure (d') describes the degree of interaction specialization at the species level, while the second measure (H2') characterizes the degree of specialization or partitioning among two parties in the entire network. Both indices are mathematically related and derived from Shannon entropy. The species-level index d' can be used to analyze variation within networks, while H2' as a network-level index is useful for comparisons across different interaction webs. Analyses of two published pollinator networks identified differences and features that have not been detected with previous approaches. For instance, plants and pollinators within a network differed in their average degree of specialization (weighted mean d'), and the correlation between specialization of pollinators and their relative abundance also differed between the webs. Rarefied sampling effort in both networks and null model simulations suggest that H2' is not affected by network size or sampling intensity.CONCLUSION:Quantitative analyses reflect properties of interaction networks more appropriately than previous qualitative attempts, and are robust against variation in sampling intensity, network size and symmetry. These measures will improve our understanding of patterns of specialization within and across networks from a broad spectrum of biological interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {The topology of ecological interaction webs holds important information for theories of coevolution, biodiversity, and ecosystem stability . However, most previous network analyses solely counted the number of links and ignored variation in link strength. Because of this crude resolution, results vary with scale and sampling intensity, thus hampering a comparison of network patterns at different levels . We applied a recently developed quantitative and scale-independent analysis based on information theory to 51 mutualistic plant-animal networks, with interaction frequency as measure of link strength. Most networks were highly structured, deviating significantly from random associations. The degree of specialization was independent of network size. Pollination webs were significantly more specialized than seed-dispersal webs, and obligate symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms were more specialized than nectar-mediated facultative ones. Across networks, the average specialization of animal and plants was correlated, but is constrained by the ratio of plant to animal species involved. In pollination webs, rarely visited plants were on average more specialized than frequently attended ones, whereas specialization of pollinators was positively correlated with their interaction frequency. We conclude that quantitative specialization in ecological communities mirrors evolutionary trade-offs and constraints of web architecture. This approach can be easily expanded to other types of biological interactions.},

However, up until recently, attention was almost exclusively given to networks in which all components were treated on equivalent footing, while neglecting all the extra information about the temporal- or context-related properties of the interactions under study. Only in the last years, taking advantage of the enhanced resolution in real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the multiplex character of real-world systems, and explicitly considered the time-varying and multilayer nature of networks. We offer here a comprehensive review on both structural and dynamical organization of graphs made of diverse relationships (layers) between its constituents, and cover several relevant issues, from a full redefinition of the basic structural measures, to understanding how the multilayer nature of the network affects processes and dynamics.},

  abstract      = {New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) numbers and distribution were reduced by human exploitation but the species is now re-colonizing much of its former range. Pinnipeds occupy two different habitat media: the marine (feeding) and terrestrial (breeding) environments. Measures of geographic variation in both these environments can be modelled together to predict coastline suitability for colonization (i.e. potential availability of breeding sites). To avoid problems of non-linear modelling, we used an artificial neural network (ANN) to: (1) predict the suitability of coastline in South Island, New Zealand to support breeding A. forsteri colonies by creating a model using pup condition (measured from 20 breeding colonies during 1996¬Ø98), prey distribution and abundance, bathymetry, and the type of coastal substrate; (2) compare the predicted distribution of suitable coastline for colonization from the model to the current distribution of A. forsteri colonies (n=198 colonies); and (3) using ANN inference rule extraction, determine which factors are the most influential in predicting coastline suitability. ANN model predictions overlapped current distributions of A. forsteri colonies in South Island. Inference rule extraction gave good predictions of colony performance (i.e. the ability to predict observed pup condition); however, they were not consistent among years in terms of the prey species constituting the rules or in the direction of the relationships. Arrow squid and octopus were important model terms in 1996 and 1997, but the direction of their coefficients in the inference rules were opposite between years. Hoki was an important term in 1997 and 1998, but it also varied in direction between years. Terms of secondary importance include the distance from sample colonies to 250 m-, 500 m- and 1000 m-isobaths. Variation in model predictions may result from climatic variation, the constant index of prey availability that was used and the potential for A. forsteri to switch main prey species among year. Resource availability appears to be a good predictor of the potential distribution of A. forsteri colonies, but future models should attempt to incorporate indices of temporal variation in resource availability as well as population density to better predict the colonization process and understand the ecological mechanisms operating within.},

The combined multiscale nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of the underlying networks make it difficult to develop an intuitive understanding of these processes, to distinguish relevant from peripheral factors, to predict their time course, and to locate their origin. However, we show that complex spatiotemporal patterns can be reduced to surprisingly simple, homogeneous wave propagation patterns, if conventional geographic distance is replaced by a probabilistically motivated effective distance. In the context of global, air-traffic-mediated epidemics, we show that effective distance reliably predicts disease arrival times. Even if epidemiological parameters are unknown, the method can still deliver relative arrival times. The approach can also identify the spatial origin of spreading processes and successfully be applied to data of the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and 2003 SARS epidemic.},

The framework is a state-space model where the population processes are modelled by the state process and measurements are modelled by the observation process. In many cases, the expected value for the state process can be represented as a generalisation of the standard population projection matrix: each sub-process within the state process may be modelled by a separate matrix and the product of these matrices is a generalised Leslie matrix. By selecting appropriate matrices and their ordering, a wide range of models may be specified. The method is fully flexible for allowing stochastic variation in the processes. Process parameters may themselves be modelled as functions of covariates. The structure accommodates effects such as density dependence, competition and predator-prey relationships, and metapopulations are readily modelled. Observations on the population enter through an observation process model, and we show how likelihood functions can be built that reflect both demographic stochasticity (which appears in the state process) and stochastic errors in the observations. Parameter estimation and estimation of state process variables can be conducted using sequential Monte Carlo procedures. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Trophic relationships are often depicted as networks, in which species are connected by links representing predatory interactions. Network analyses have also been applied to non-trophic species interactions, such as pollination and seed dispersal mutualisms, to summarize community-level patterns in mutually beneficial interactions. However, the processes responsible for common network properties such as degree distributions (the number of interactions maintained by each species in the network) and nestedness (the tendency for specialists to interact with perfect subsets of the species interacting with generalists) are poorly understood. 2. I evaluated the network properties of a novel type of species interaction, commensal interactions between epiphytes and their host trees. I quantified the occurrence of 19 vascular epiphyte species on seven host tree species in a metacommunity of epiphytes in New Zealand. I then developed null models to test whether observed network properties result from the frequency of species interactions, which is a commonly cited but rarely tested explanation for degree distributions and nestedness. 3. Results showed that degree distributions of both epiphyte and host tree species were consistent with a null model that randomly populated hosts with epiphytes. Several null models that test for nestedness by randomly linking pairs of interacting species showed significantly higher nestedness in the real community. In fact, the observed level of nestedness was among the highest yet recorded for any type of ecological interaction. A second null model that randomized species interactions according to their overall frequencies of occurrence in the community confirmed support for nestedness. 4. Results indicate that the degree distributions were consistent with randomized expectations; the number of interactions maintained by both epiphyte and host tree species appears to be determined by their frequency of occurrence in the community. However, interaction frequencies could be ruled-out as an explanation for nestedness. Nested epiphyte‚Äìhost interactions may instead result from a predictable sequence of epiphyte succession, wherein earlier colonists ameliorate environmental conditions within host trees for later recruiting species.},

  Abstract                 = {Epiphytes are an important component of many forested ecosystems, yet our understanding of epiphyte communities lags far behind that of terrestrial-based plant communities. This discrepancy is exacerbated by the lack of a theoretical context to assess patterns in epiphyte community structure. We attempt to fill this gap by developing an analytical framework to investigate epiphyte assemblages, which we then apply to a data set on epiphyte distributions in a Panamanian rain forest. On a coarse scale, interactions between epiphyte species and host tree species can be viewed as bipartite networks, similar to pollination and seed dispersal networks. On a finer scale, epiphyte communities on individual host trees can be viewed as meta-communities, or suites of local epiphyte communities connected by dispersal. Similar analytical tools are typically employed to investigate species interaction networks and meta-communities, thus providing a unified analytical framework to investigate coarse-scale (network) and fine-scale (meta-community) patterns in epiphyte distributions. Coarse-scale analysis of the Panamanian data set showed that most epiphyte species interacted with fewer host species than expected by chance. Fine-scale analyses showed that epiphyte species richness on individual trees was lower than null model expectations. Therefore, epiphyte distributions were clumped at both scales, perhaps as a result of dispersal limitations. Scale-dependent patterns in epiphyte species composition were observed. Epiphyte‚Äìhost networks showed evidence of negative co-occurrence patterns, which could arise from adaptations among epiphyte species to avoid competition for host species, while most epiphyte meta-communities were distributed at random. Application of our ‚Äò‚Äòmeta- network‚Äô‚Äô analytical framework in other locales may help to identify general patterns in the structure of epiphyte assemblages and their variation in space and time.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Biological communities are organized in complex interaction networks such as food webs, which topology appears to be non-random. Gradients, compartments, nested subsets and even combinations of these structures have been shown in bipartite networks. However, in most studies only one pattern is tested against randomness and mechanistic hypotheses are generally lacking. 2. Here we examined the topology of regional, coexisting plant-herbivore and host-parasitoid food webs to discriminate between the mentioned network patterns. We also evaluated the role of species body size, local abundance, regional frequency and phylogeny as determinants of network topology. 3. We found both food webs to be compartmented, with interaction range boundaries imposed by host phylogeny. Species degree within compartments was mostly related to their regional frequency and local abundance. Only one compartment showed an internal nested structure in the distribution of interactions between species, but species position within this compartment was unrelated to species size or abundance. 4. These results suggest that compartmentalization may be more common than previously considered, and that network structure is a result of multiple, hierarchical, non-exclusive processes.},

  abstract      = {Predictive modeling of vegetation patterns has wide application in vegetation science. In this paper I discuss three methods of predictive modeling using data from the alpine treeline ecotone as a case study. The study area is a portion of Glacier National Park, Montana. Parametric general linear models (GLM), artificial neural networks (ANN) and classification tree (CT) methods of predicting vegetation type are compared to determine the relative strength of each predictive approach and how they may be used in concert to increase understanding of important vegetation ‚Äì environment relations. For each predictive method, vegetation type within the alpine treeline ecotone is predicted using a suite of environmental indicator variables including elevation, moisture potential, solar radiation potential, snow potential index, and disturbance history. Results from each of the predictive methods are compared against the real vegetation types to determine the relative accuracy of the methods.When the entire data field is examined (i.e., not evaluated by smaller spatial aggregates of data) the ANN procedure produces the most accurate predictions (k=0.571); the CT predictions are the least accurate (k=0.351). The predicted patterns of vegetation on the landscape are considerably different using the three methods. The GLM and CT methods produce large contiguous swaths of vegetation types throughout the study area, whereas the ANN method produces patterns with much more heterogeneity and smaller patches.When predictions are compared to reality at catchment scale, it becomes evident that the accuracy of each method varies depending upon the specific situation. The ANN procedure remains the most accurate method in the majority of the catchments, but both the GLM and PCT produce the most accurate classifications in at least one basin each.The variability in predictive ability of the three methods tested here indicates that there may not be a single best predictive method. Rather it may be important to use a suite of predictive models to help understand the environment ‚Äì vegetation relationships. The ability to use multiple predictive methods to determine which spatial subunits of a landscape are outliers is important when identifying locations useful for climate change monitoring studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Interaction networks are central elements of ecological systems and have very complex structures. Historically, much effort has focused on niche-mediated processes to explain these structures, while an emerging consensus posits that both niche and neutral mechanisms simultaneously shape many features of ecological communities. However, the study of interaction networks still lacks a comprehensive neutral theory. Here we present a neutral model of predator-prey interactions and analyze the structural characteristics of the simulated networks. We find that connectance values (complexity) and complexity-diversity relationships of neutral networks are close to those observed in empirical bipartite networks. High nestedness and low modularity values observed in neutral networks fall in the range of those from empirical antagonist bipartite networks. Our results suggest that, as an alternative to niche-mediated processes that induce incompatibility between species ("niche forbidden links"), neutral processes create "neutral forbidden links" due to uneven species abundance distributions and the low probability of interaction between rare species. Neutral trophic networks must be seen as the missing endpoint of a continuum from niche to purely stochastic approaches of community organization.},

Co-occurrence data are, nevertheless, a neglected source of information to model species distributions and biogeographers are still debating about the impact of biotic interactions on species distributions across geographical scales. We argue that a theory of species co-occurrence in ecological networks is needed to better inform interpretation of co-occurrence data, to formulate hypotheses for different community assembly mechanisms, and to extend the analysis of species distributions currently focused on the relationship between occurrences and abiotic factors. The main objective of this paper is to provide the first building blocks of a general theory for species co-occurrences. We formalize the problem with definitions of the different probabilities that are studied in the context of co-occurrence analyses. We analyze three species interactions modules and conduct multi-species simulations in order to document five principles influencing the associations between species within an ecological network: (i) direct interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (ii) indirect interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (iii) pairwise co-occurrence rarely are symmetric, (iv) the strength of an association decreases with the length of the shortest path between two species, and (v) the strength of an association decreases with the number of interactions a species is experiencing. Our analyses reveal the difficulty of the interpretation of species interactions from co-occurrence data. We discuss whether the inference of the structure of interaction networks is feasible from co-occurrence data. We also argue that species distributions models could benefit from incorporating conditional probabilities of interactions within the models as an attempt to take into account the contribution of biotic interactions to shaping individual distributions of species.},

  abstractnote = {1. Species community composition is known to alter the network of interactions between two tro- phic levels, potentially affecting its functioning (e.g. plant pollination success) and the stability of communities. Phylogenies vary in shape with regard to the rate of evolutionary change across a tree (influencing tree balance) and variation in the timing of branching events (affecting the distribution of node ages in trees), both of which may influence the structure of species interaction networks. Because related species are likely to share many of the traits that regulate interactions, the shape of phylogenetic trees may provide some insights into the distribution of traits within communities, and hence the likelihood of interaction among species. However, little attention has been paid to the potential effects of changes in phylogenetic diversity (PD) on interaction networks. 2. Phylogenetic diversity is influenced by species diversity within a community, but also how dis- tantly-related the constituent species are from one another. Here, we evaluate the relationship between two important measures of phylogenetic diversity (tree shape and age of nodes) and the structure of plant–pollinator interaction networks using empirical and simulated data. Whereas the former allows us to evaluate patterns in real communities, the latter allows us to evaluate more systematically the relationship between tree shape and network structure under three different models of trait evolution. 3. In empirical networks, less balanced plant phylogenies were associated with lower connectance in interaction networks indicating that communities with the descendants of recent radiations are more diverged and specialized in their partnerships. In simulations, tree balance and the distribution of nodes through time were included in the best models for modularity, and the second best models for connectance and nestedness. In models assuming random evolutionary change through time (i.e. Brownian motion), less balanced trees and trees with nodes near the tips exhibited greater modular- ity, whereas in models with an early burst of radiation followed by relative stasis (i.e. early-burst models) more balanced trees and trees with nodes near roots had greater modularity. 4. Synthesis. Overall, these results suggest that the shape of phylogenies can influence the structure of plant–pollinator interaction networks. However, the mismatch between simulations and empirical data indicate that…},

  Abstract                 = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events—and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behav- ior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law dis- tributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

Accordingly, their research tends to track the particularities and peculiarities of a given group and seldom enquires whether there are any wider or deeper sets of explanations. Here, I present evidence in support of the heterodox idea that evolution might look to a general theory that does more than serve as a tautology (“evolution explains evolution”). Specifically, I argue that far from its myriad of products being fortuitous and accidental, evolution is remarkably predictable. Thus, I urge a move away from the continuing obsession with Darwinian mechanisms, which are entirely uncontroversial. Rather, I emphasize why we should seek explanations for ubiquitous evolutionary convergence, as well as the emergence of complex integrated systems. At present, evolutionary theory seems to be akin to nineteenth-century physics, blissfully unaware of the imminent arrival of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Physics had its Newton, biology its Darwin: evolutionary biology now awaits its Einstein.},

  abstractnote = {Ecological networks are an increasingly popular tool to explore community assembly rules and frame practical conservation issues. However, most described networks vary largely in sampling effort, hampering the distinction of true biological patterns from artefacts caused by poor sampling. Identifying entire seeds in the droppings of mist-netted birds is generally considered a preferred sampling method for building unbiased, quantitative seed dispersal networks. We retrieved seeds from the droppings of 936 mist-netted birds captured during five days in seven sites in Portugal and estimated sampling completeness as the diversity of seed species, disperser species, and links detected with respect to those predicted by Chao 2 estimator. In one of those sites, sampling effort was extended to 25 days to evaluate the sensitivity of ten network structure descriptors to increasing sampling effort. After five sampling days we detected 93% of the seed species, 97% of the disperser species, and 79% of the links predicted by Chao 2, however sampling for 25 days resulted in the detection of more seeds, dispersers, and links than those estimated at day 5. Most network descriptors only began to stabilize around day 8, except for Connectance and Weighted Connectance that stabilized earlier. Similarly, only after 8 days most networks descriptors significantly departed from the confidence interval estimated by null models exclusively constrained by species abundances, thus reflecting independent ecological patterns. Nestedness was the only exception, as it never departed from the null models. We suggest that Chao 2 may slightly underestimate the real diversity and that in our case at least eight sampling days were needed to build a sound seed dispersal network as 67% of the seeds, 88% of the dispersers, and 71% of the links were detected. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of seed dispersal networks because under-sampled networks may produce biased descriptors that do not suitably characterize the focal communities.},

We show that the predictions of a spatially explicit, individual-based model result from reduced rates of predation and reproduction caused by limited individual mobility and patchiness. When these reduced rates are used in a mean-field model, there is better agreement with the predictions of the simulation model incorporating local interactions. We also explain previous findings regarding the effects of dimensionality on population dynamics in light of diffusion-limited reactions and P{\'{o}}lya random walks. In particular, we demonstrate that 3D systems are better "stirred" than 2D systems and consequently have a reduced tendency for diffusion-limited interaction rates.},

We assessed the replicability of the number of interactions found among species and also whether there had been changes in the network structure associated with appearance of new ant and plant species during that 10-year period. Our results show that the nested topology of the network was similar between sampling dates, group dissimilarity increased, mean number of interactions for ant species increased, the frequency distribution of standardized degrees reached higher values for plant species, more ant species and fewer plant species constituted the core of the more recent network, and the presence of new ant and plant species increased while their contribution to nestedness remained the same. Generalist species (i.e., those with the most links or interactions) appeared to maintain the stability of the network because the new species incorporated into the communities were linked to this core of generalists. Camponotus planatus was the most extreme generalist ant species (the one with the most links) in both networks, followed by four other ant species; but other species changed either their position along the continuum of generalists relative to specialists or their presence or absence within the network. Even though new species moved into the area during the decade between the surveys, the overall network structure remained unmodified.},

  Abstract                 = {Network analysis has in recent years improved our understanding of pollination systems. However, there is very little information about how functionally specialized plants and pollinators interact directly and indirectly in pollination networks. We have developed a parameter, Functional specialization index, to quantify functional specialization in pollination networks. Using this parameter, we examined whether different sized hummingbirds visit a distinct set of flowers in five hummingbird-pollinated plant assemblages from the Lesser Antilles, obtaining a simple relationship between hummingbird body size, network parameter and ecological function. In the Lesser Antilles, functionally specialized hummingbird pollination is distinct for plant species pollinated by the largest hummingbird species, whereas the pollination niche gradually integrates with the insect pollinator community as hummingbird body size decreases. The network approach applied in this study can be used to validate functional specialization and community-level interdependence between plants and pollinators, and it is therefore useful for evaluating and predicting plant resilience to pollinator loss, presently a global concern.},

However, such modularity is infrequent in seed dispersal networks, presumably because research on those networks predominantly includes a single taxonomic animal group (e.g. birds). Herein, for the first time, we examine the pattern of interaction in a network that includes multiple taxonomic groups of seed dispersers, and the mechanisms underlying modularity. We found that the network was nested and modular, with five distinguishable modules. Our examination of the mechanisms underlying such modularity showed that plant and animal trait values were associated with specific modules but phylogenetic effect was limited. Thus, the pattern of interaction in this network is only partially explained by shared evolutionary history. We conclude that the observed modularity emerged by a combination of phylogenetic history and trait convergence of phylogenetically unrelated species, shaped by interactions with particular types of dispersal agents.},

  Abstract                 = {Many analyses of ecological networks in recent years have introduced new indices to describe network properties. As a consequence, tens of indices are available to address similar questions, differing in specific detail, sensitivity in detecting the property in question, and robustness with respect to network size and sampling intensity. Furthermore, some indices merely reflect the number of species participating in a network, but not their interrelationship, requiring a null model approach. Here we introduce a new, free software calculating a large spectrum of network indices, visualizing bipartite networks and generating null models. We use this tool to explore the sensitivity of 26 network indices to network dimensions, sampling intensity and singleton observations. Based on observed data, we investigate the interrelationship of these indices, and show that they are highly correlated, and heavily influenced by network dimensions and connectance. Finally, we re-evaluate five common hypotheses about network properties, comparing 19 pollination networks with three differently complex null models: 1. The number of links per species (“degree”) follow (truncated) power law distributions. 2. Generalist pollinators interact with specialist plants, and vice versa (dependence asymmetry). 3. Ecological networks are nested. 4. Pollinators display complementarity, owing to specialization within the network. 5. Plant-pollinator networks are more robust to extinction than random networks. Our results indicate that while some hypotheses hold up against our null models, others are to a large extent understandable on the basis of network size, rather than ecological interrelationships. In particular, null model pattern of dependence asymmetry and robustness to extinction are opposite to what current network paradigms suggest. Our analysis, and the tools we provide, enables ecologists to readily contrast their findings with null model expectations for many different questions, thus separating statistical inevitability from ecological process.},

  Abstract                 = {Networks from a wide range of physical, biological, and social systems have been recently described as "small-world" and "scale-free." However, studies disagree whether ecological networks called food webs possess the characteristic path lengths, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions required for membership in these classes of networks. Our analysis suggests that the disagreements are based on selective use of relatively few food webs, as well as analytical decisions that obscure important variability in the data. We analyze a broad range of 16 high-quality food webs, with 25-172 nodes, from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Food webs generally have much higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than other networks studied, which have important implications for network topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that although some food webs have small-world and scale-free structure, most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance. Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal functional form, observed distributions are systematically related to network connectance and size. Also, although food webs often lack small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum of real-world networks including food webs whose ratios of observed to random clustering coefficients increase as a power-law function of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although food webs are generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Co-existing plants and flower-visiting animals often form complex interaction networks. A long-standing question in ecology and evolutionary biology is how to detect nonrandom subsets (compartments, blocks, modules) of strongly interacting species within such networks. Here we use a network analytical approach to (i) detect modularity in pollination networks, (ii) investigate species composition of modules, and (iii) assess the stability of modules across sites. Interactions between entomophilous plants and their flower-visitors were recorded throughout the flowering season at three heathland sites in Denmark, separated by 2265 10 km. Among sites, plant communities were similar, but composition of flower-visiting insect faunas differed. Visitation frequencies of visitor species were recorded as a measure of insect abundance. Qualitative (presence2013absence) interaction networks were tested for modularity. Modules were identified, and species classified into topological roles (peripherals, connectors, or hubs) using 'functional cartography by simulated annealing', a method recently developed by Guimer{\`{a}} {\&} Amaral (2005a). All networks were significantly modular. Each module consisted of 120136 plant species and 18201354 insect species. Interactions aggregated around one or two hub plant species, which were largely identical at the three study sites. Insect species were categorized in taxonomic groups, mostly at the level of orders. When weighted by visitation frequency, each module was dominated by one or few insect groups. This pattern was consistent across sites. Our study adds support to the conclusion that certain plant species and flower-visitor groups are nonrandomly and repeatedly associated. Within a network, these strongly interacting subgroups of species may exert reciprocal selection pressures on each other. Thus, modules may be candidates for the long-sought key units of co-evolution.},

  abstractnote = {Pollination networks are representations of all interactions between co-existing plants and their flower visiting animals at a given site. Although the study of networks has become a distinct sub-discipline in pollination biology, few studies have attempted to quantify spatio-temporal variation in species composition and structure of networks. We here investigate patterns of year-to-year change in pollination networks from six different sites spanning a large latitudinal gradient. We quantified level of species persistence and interactions among years, and examined year-to-year variation of network structural parameters in relation to latitude and sampling effort. In addition, we tested for correlations between annual variation in network parameters and short and long-term climate change variables. Numbers of plant and animal species and interactions were roughly constant from one year to another at all sites. However, composition of species and interactions changed from one year to another. Turnover was particularly high for flower visitors and interactions. On the other hand, network structural parameters (connectance, nestedness, modularity and centralization) remained remarkably constant between years, regardless of network size and latitude. Inter-annual variation of network parameters was not related to short or long term variation in climate variables (mean annual temperature and annual precipitation). We thus conclude that pollination networks are highly dynamic and variable in composition of species and interactions among years. However, general patterns of network structure remain constant, indicating that species may be replaced by topologically similar species. These results suggest that pollination networks are to some extent robust against factors affecting species occurrences},

  Abstract                 = {Pollinators play a key role in the reproduction of most plant species, and pollinator and plant diversity are often related. We studied an experimental gradient of plant species richness for a better understanding of plant2013pollinator community interactions and their temporal variability, because in non-experimental field surveys plant richness is often confounded with gradients in management, soil fertility, and community composition. We observed pollinator species richness and frequency of visits six times in 73 plots over two years, and used advanced statistical analysis to account for the high number of zeroes that often occur in count data of rare species. The frequency of pollinator visits increased linearly with both the blossom cover and the number of flowering plant species, which was closely related to the total number of plant species, whereas the number of pollinator species followed a saturation curve. The presence of particularly attractive plant species was only important for the frequency of flower visits, but not to the richness of pollinators. Plant species richness, blossom cover, and the presence of attractive plant species enhanced the temporal stability in the frequency of pollinator visits. In conclusion, grasslands with high plant diversity enhance and stabilize frequent and diverse flower visitations, which should sustain effective pollination and plant reproduction.},

  Abstract                 = {How many dimensions (trait-axes) are required to predict whether two species interact? This unanswered question originated with the idea of ecological niches, and yet bears relevance today for understanding what determines network structure. Here, we analyse a set of 200 ecological networks, including food webs, antagonistic and mutualistic networks, and find that the number of dimensions needed to completely explain all interactions is small ( < 10), with model selection favouring less than five. Using 18 high-quality webs including several species traits, we identify which traits contribute the most to explaining network structure. We show that accounting for a few traits dramatically improves our understanding of the structure of ecological networks. Matching traits for resources and consumers, for example, fruit size and bill gape, are the most successful combinations. These results link ecologically important species attributes to large-scale community structure.},

Comparing our findings with other studies, we get that the proportion of dipteran species of the total pollinator fauna increases with latitude but that the proportions of species of Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera do not vary significantly among high latitude systems. Muscidae and Empididae were more abundant and generalised than other dipteran families visiting flowers in the arctic, their proportions of the total Diptera fauna increase with latitude and they are the most widespread Families of flower-visiting insects in the arctic. Several Muscidae species are typical to alpine habitats in the arctic-subarctic zone. These species have special pollen feeding behaviour and an elongated proboscis, which improves access to closed flowers. Compared to other published pollination system studies, the connectance of low latitude systems ranges between 3.4 and 28.1, whereas high latitude and high altitude systems vary between 8.6 and 19 (-60).},

  abstract      = {Summary
Uncovering the processes that shape the architecture of interaction networks is a major challenge in ecology. Studies have consistently revealed that more closely related taxa tend to show greater overlap in interaction partners, fuelling the idea that interactions are phylogenetically conserved [1–8]. However, local ecological processes such as exploitative or apparent competition (indirect interactions) might instead cause a decrease in overlap in interacting partners. Because of the taxonomic and geographic coarseness of existing studies [2–5, 7], the structuring effect of such processes has been overlooked. Here, we assess the relative importance of phylogeny and ecological processes in a local, highly resolved, four-level antagonistic network. Across all network levels we consistently find that phylogenetic relatedness among resource species is correlated with consumer overlap but that phylogenetic relatedness among consumer species is not or negatively correlated with resource overlap. This pervasive pattern indicates that the antagonistic network has been shaped by both phylogeny on resource range and by exploitative competition limiting resource overlap among closely related consumer species. Intriguingly, the strength of phylogenetic signal varies in a consistent way across the network levels. We discuss the generality of our findings and their implications in a changing world.},

  abstractnote = {The interactions between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) maintain a crucial link between macroscopic organisms and the soil microbial world. These interactions are of extreme importance for the diversity of plant communities and ecosystem functioning. Despite this importance, only recently has the structure of plant-AMF interaction networks been studied. These recent studies, which used genetic data, suggest that these networks are highly structured, very similar to plant-animal mutualistic networks. However, the assembly process of plant-AMF communities is still largely unknown, and an important feature of plant-AMF interactions has not been incorporated: they occur at an extremely localized scale. Studying plant-AMF networks in a spatial context seems therefore a crucial step. This paper studies a plant-AMF spatial co-occurrence network using novel methodology based on information theory and a unique set of spatially explicit species-level data. We apply three null models of which only one accounts for spatial effects. We find that the data show substantial departures from null expectations for the two non-spatial null models. However, for the null model considering spatial effects, there are few significant co-occurrences compared with the other two null models. Thus, plant-AMF spatial co-occurrences seem to be mostly explained by stochasticity, with a small role for other factors related to plant-AMF specialization. Furthermore, we find that the network is not significantly nested or modular. We conclude that this plant-AMF spatial co-occurrence network lacks substantial structure and, therefore, plants and AMF species do not track each other over space. Thus, random encounters seem more important in the first step of the assembly of plant-AMF communities. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the environmental factors that structure biodiversity and food webs among communities is central to assess and mitigate the impact of landscape changes. Wildflower strips are ecological compensation areas established in farmland to increase pollination services and biological control of crop pests and to conserve insect diversity. They are arranged in networks in order to favour high species richness and abundance of the fauna. We describe results from experimental wildflower strips in a fragmented agricultural landscape, comparing the importance of landscape, of spatial arrangement and of vegetation on the diversity and abundance of trap-nesting bees, wasps and their enemies, and the structure of their food webs. The proportion of forest cover close to the wildflower strips and the landscape heterogeneity stood out as the most influential landscape elements, resulting in a more complex trap-nest community with higher abundance and richness of hosts, and with more links between species in the food webs and a higher diversity of interactions. We disentangled the underlying mechanisms for variation in these quantitative food web metrics. We conclude that in order to increase the diversity and abundance of pollinators and biological control agents and to favour a potentially stable community of cavity-nesting hymenoptera in wildflower strips, more investment is needed in the conservation and establishment of forest habitats within agro-ecosystems, as a reservoir of beneficial insect populations.},

  abstract      = {Community studies have shown that plant species are often pollinated by multiple pollinators; however, networks of heterospecific pollen transfer (HPT) in natural communities remain largely unexplored. We analyzed pollen deposition on stigmas of 57 flowering species to build a picture of plant-plant interactions via HPT in a biodiverse alpine meadow in southwest China. Plant species were categorized as pollen donors or recipients by their link numbers and link qualities. We identified 3609 heterospecific pollen grains, representing 410 links among 69 pollen species. Each plant species received on average 7.2 pollen species and donated its pollen to 5.5 species; only a few species donated or received large amounts of pollen or pollen from a large number of species. Compared to specialized plants, generalized plants tended to receive more heterospecific pollen but exported no more pollen to other species. Plant position in the network was related to both floral traits (stigma position) and pollinator generalization level. When different species share the same pollinator, bidirectional HPT may occur, but this was rarely observed in the species-rich community, indicating that interspecific pollen interference was largely unidirectional. Our study highlights the importance of understanding how sympatric flowering plants reduce deleterious effects of HPT, for example via stigma position. This study is the first to present a pollen transfer network for an entire community and to unravel its properties using directed network analysis.},

  abstractnote = {1. In the tropics, many plants offer housing and food for their specialized ant partners which, in return, offer benefit in the form of defence and/or nutrients, thus forming mutualistic bonds. Such ant-plants, also called myrmecophytes, occur together at a local scale, generating community patterns of mutualistic ant-plant associations. Here, we present the first fully quantitative description of an ant-myrmecophyte community. 2. The study site in Central Amazonian tropical rainforest had a high myrmecophyte density of about 380 ind. ha(-1). Sixteen myrmecophyte and 25 ant species were recorded, the species abundance rank curves being highly uneven. 3. The ant-myrmecophyte matrix was highly compartmentalized, and a Monte Carlo simulation showed that the observed pattern was not a product of chance and sample size (P < 0 . 0001). Cluster analyses indicated that compartments were partially explained by occurrence of the ants in phylogenetically related host plants, but not by habitat specificity. 4. The connectance of the ant-plant community was 12%. This value seems quite low when compared with published results from other mutualistic systems (pollinator and seed-disperser), after controlling for the total number of interacting species. The high frequency of null interactions in the ant-myrmecophyte system could not be explained by the “phenological non-coincidence hypothesis”, since both ant and plant partners occur together throughout the year. 5. Ant-plant interactions were highly asymmetrical: ant species had fewer partners than plant species and ants were more dependent on the plants than the reverse. These asymmetries are in the opposite direction to those recorded for plant-pollinators and plant-dispersers; however, they seem to be :he product of the same underlying process: differential fitness benefits between mutualistic partners. 6. The low number of ant and plant partners per compartment, coupled with an apparently high temporal and spatial stability of ant-myrmecophyte interactions, suggests that compartments are the appropriate scale at which to investigate coevolution in ant-myrmecophyte systems.},

However, the impact of human-induced biodiversity loss on the functioning of plant-pollinator interactions has not been tested experimentally. To understand how plant communities respond to diversity changes in their pollinating fauna, we manipulated the functional diversity of both plants and pollinators under natural conditions. Increasing the functional diversity of both plants and pollinators led to the recruitment of more diverse plant communities. After two years the plant communities pollinated by the most functionally diverse pollinator assemblage contained about 50% more plant species than did plant communities pollinated by less-diverse pollinator assemblages. Moreover, the positive effect of functional diversity was explained by a complementarity between functional groups of pollinators and plants. Thus, the functional diversity of pollination networks may be critical to ecosystem sustainability.},

  Abstract                 = {Interactions among species drive the ecological and evolutionary processes in ecological communities. These interactions are effectively key components of biodiversity. Studies that use a network approach to study the structure and dynamics of communities of interacting species have revealed many patterns and associated processes. Historically these studies were restricted to trophic interactions, although network approaches are now used to study a wide range of interactions, including for example the reproductive mutualisms. However, each interaction type remains studied largely in isolation from others. Merging the various interaction types within a single integrative framework is necessary if we want to further our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of communities. Dividing the networks up is a methodological convenience as in the field the networks occur together in space and time and will be linked by shared species. Herein, we outline a conceptual framework for studying networks composed of more than one type of interaction, highlighting key questions and research areas that would benefit from their study.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Understanding the structure of ecological networks is a crucial task for interpreting community and ecosystem responses to global change. 2. Despite the recent interest in this subject, almost all studies have focused exclusively on one specific network property. The question remains as to what extent different network properties are related and how understanding this relationship can advance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind these patterns. 3. Here, we analysed the relationship between nestedness and modularity, two frequently studied network properties, for a large data set of 95 ecological communities including both plant-animal mutualistic and host-parasite networks. 4. We found that the correlation between nestedness and modularity for a population of random matrices generated from the real communities decreases significantly in magnitude and sign with increasing connectance independent of the network type. At low connectivities, networks that are highly nested also tend to be highly modular; the reverse happens at high connectivities. 5. The above result is qualitatively robust when different null models are used to infer network structure, but, at a finer scale, quantitative differences exist. We observed an important interaction between the network structure pattern and the null model used to detect it. 6. A better understanding of the relationship between nestedness and modularity is important given their potential implications on the dynamics and stability of ecological communities.},

  Abstract                 = {Temporal patterns of flower opening and closure within a day are known as Linn{\'{e}}'s floral clock. Time of flower closure has been explained mainly by light in the traditional botanical literature. We show with a set of experiments that Asteraceae flower heads can close within three hours after pollination, whereas un-pollinated flower heads stay open until the late afternoon. This suggests that closing time strongly depends on pollinators. Using plant-pollinator interaction webs we further demonstrate that the daily pattern of flower opening and the rapid response to pollination can impose strong temporal dynamics on interspecific interactions within a single day. We observed pollinator species turnover and changes in facilitation vs. competition among plants. Our results show for the first time that pollination induces rapid flower closure on the community level. This causes imprecision in Linn{\'{e}}'s floral clock with far-reaching consequences for plant-pollinator interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {In the face of global decline in biodiversity, the relationship between diversity and species interactions deserves particular attention. If pollinators are strongly dependent on floral diversity due to mutual specialization, declines in plant diversity, e.g. caused by land use intensification, may be associated with linked extinctions of pollinators. However, the general extent of pollinator specialization is still poorly known. To explore the dependence of local bee and hoverfly communities on flower diversity, we recorded flower supply and flower-visiting insects on 27 meadows with varying flower diversity in southern Germany and analyzed (a) whether the diversity of flower visitors is correlated with flower diversity, (b) whether the degree of dietary specialization of flower visitors changes with flower diversity and (c) whether flower preferences of individual flower visitor species are constant or variable between different communities. Flower‚Äìvisitor interaction webs were compiled during a single day on each meadow. This approach prevents relating pollinator species to flowers they never encounter because of non-overlapping phenology or spatial segregation. (a) Flower diversity and flower visitor diversity were positively correlated. (b) Flower visitor assemblies were significantly specialized at a relatively high level, contrasting to the opinion that plant‚Äìpollinator webs are highly generalized, and providing a possible explanation for the positive diversity correlation. However, the level of specialization did not change significantly across the gradient of flower diversity, suggesting that pollinators are partitioned to a similar extent in each meadow. (c) In the analysis of ten common flower visitor species previously categorized as generalists, strong evidence was found for both, consistent preferences and preferences that differ between sites. These results indicate a flexibility in flower preferences and a dynamic resource partitioning among pollinators. Generally, our findings highlight the complexity of plant‚Äìpollinator interactions and confirm the importance of flower diversity for bee and hoverfly communities.},

  abstractnote = {We typically observe large-scale outcomes that arise from the interactions of many hidden, small-scale processes. Examples include age of disease onset, rates of amino acid substitutions and composition of ecological communities. The macroscopic patterns in each problem often vary around a characteristic shape that can be generated by neutral processes. A neutral generative model assumes that each microscopic process follows unbiased or random stochastic fluctuations: random connections of network nodes; amino acid substitutions with no effect on fitness; species that arise or disappear from communities randomly. These neutral generative models often match common patterns of nature. In this paper, I present the theoretical background by which we can understand why these neutral generative models are so successful. I show where the classic patterns come from, such as the Poisson pattern, the normal or Gaussian pattern and many others. Each classic pattern was often discovered by a simple neutral generative model. The neutral patterns share a special characteristic: they describe the patterns of nature that follow from simple constraints on information. For example, any aggregation of processes that preserves information only about the mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the mean attracts to the exponential pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the geometric mean attracts to the power law pattern. I present a simple and consistent informational framework of the common patterns of nature based on the method of maximum entropy. This framework shows that each neutral generative model is a special case that helps to discover a particular set of informational constraints; those informational constraints define a much wider domain of non-neutral generative processes that attract to the same neutral pattern.},

  Abstract                 = {It is widely assumed that floral diversification occurs by adaptive shifts between pollination niches. In contrast to specialized flowers, identifying pollination niches of generalist flowers is a challenge. Consequently, how generalist pollination niches evolve is largely unknown. We apply tools from network theory and comparative methods to investigate the evolution of pollination niches among generalist species belonging to the genus Erysimum. These species have similar flowers. We found that the studied species may be grouped in several multidimensional niches separated not by a shift of pollinators, but instead by quantitative variation in the relative abundance of pollinator functional groups. These pollination niches did not vary in generalization degree; we did not find any evolutionary trend toward specialization within the studied clade. Furthermore, the evolution of pollination niche fitted to a Brownian motion model without phylogenetic signal, and was characterized by frequent events of niche convergences and divergences. We presume that the evolution of Erysimum pollination niches has occurred mostly by recurrent shifts between slightly different generalized pollinator assemblages varying spatially as a mosaic and without any change in specialization degree. Most changes in pollination niches do not prompt floral divergence, a reason why adaptation to pollinators is uncommon in generalist plants.},

Here, we analysed food webs of cereal aphids, their primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids in 18 agricultural landscapes differing in structural complexity (42-93% arable land). Despite little variation in the richness of each trophic group, we found considerable changes in trophic link properties across the landscape complexity gradient. Unexpectedly, aphid-parasitoid food webs exhibited a lower complexity (lower linkage density, interaction diversity and generality) in structurally complex landscapes, which was related to the dominance of one aphid species in complex landscapes. Nevertheless, primary parasitism, as well as hyperparasitism, was higher in complex landscapes, with primary parasitism reaching levels for potentially successful biological control. In conclusion, landscape complexity appeared to foster higher parasitism rates, but simpler food webs, thereby casting doubt on the general importance of food web complexity for ecosystem functioning.},

Seven methods which can give the relative contribution and/or the contribution profile of the input factors were compared: (i) the `PaD' (for Partial Derivatives) method consists in a calculation of the partial derivatives of the output according to the input variables; (ii) the `Weights' method is a computation using the connection weights; (iii) the `Perturb' method corresponds to a perturbation of the input variables; (iv) the `Profile' method is a successive variation of one input variable while the others are kept constant at a fixed value; (v) the `classical stepwise' method is an observation of the change in the error value when an adding (forward) or an elimination (backward) step of the input variables is operated; (vi) `Improved stepwise a' uses the same principle as the classical stepwise, but the elimination of the input occurs when the network is trained, the connection weights corresponding to the input variable studied is also eliminated; (vii) `Improved stepwise b' involves the network being trained and fixed step by step, one input variable at its mean value to note the consequences on the error. The data tested in this study concerns the prediction of the density of brown trout spawning redds using habitat characteristics. The PaD method was found to be the most useful as it gave the most complete results, followed by the Profile method that gave the contribution profile of the input variables. The Perturb method allowed a good classification of the input parameters as well as the Weights method that has been simplified but these two methods lack stability. Next came the two improved stepwise methods (a and b) that both gave exactly the same result but the contributions were not sufficiently expressed. Finally, the classical stepwise methods gave the poorest results.},

  Abstract                 = {Concerns have been raised that invertebrate pollinators of crops and wild plants are in decline as a result of modern agricultural practices, habitat degradation, and introduced pests and diseases. This has led to demands for a response by land managers, conservationists and political decision makers to the impending 'global pollinator crisis'. In questioning this crisis, it becomes apparent that perceptions of a pollinator crisis are driven mainly by reported declines of crop-pollinating honeybees in North America, and bumblebees and butterflies in Europe, whereas native pollinator communities elsewhere show mixed responses to environmental change. Additionally, few staple food crops depend on pollinator services, and most crops that do are grown at small scales in diversified agro-ecosystems that are likely to support healthy pollinator communities, or in highly managed systems that are largely independent of wild pollinators. Consequently, justifying conservation action on the basis of deteriorating pollinator services might be misplaced. Nevertheless, existing initiatives to monitor pollinators are well founded, given the uncertainty about the dynamics of pollinator populations.},

Moreover, the role structure plays with cooperation has largely been studied through observing overall cooperation rather than the underlying components that together shape cooperative behavior. In this paper we address these two problems by first applying evolutionary games to a wide range of networks, where agents play the Prisoner’s Dilemma with a three-component stochastic strategy, and then analyzing agent-based simulation results using principal component analysis. With these methods we study the evolution of trust, reciprocity and forgiveness as a function of several structural parameters. This work demonstrates that community structure, represented by network modularity, among all the tested structural parameters, has the most significant impact on the emergence of cooperative behavior, with forgiveness showing the largest sensitivity to community structure. We also show that increased community structure reduces the dispersion of trust and forgiveness, thereby reducing the network-level uncertainties for these two components; graph transitivity and degree also significantly influence the evolutionary dynamics of the population and the diversity of strategies at equilibrium.},

  Abstract                 = {A statistical challenge in community ecology is to identify segregated and aggregated pairs of species from a binary presence-absence matrix, which often contains hundreds or thousands of such potential pairs. A similar challenge is found in genomics and proteomics, where the expression of thousands of genes in microarrays must be statistically analyzed. Here we adapt the empirical Bayes method to identify statistically significant species pairs in a binary presence-absence matrix. We evaluated the performance of a simple confidence interval, a sequential Bonferroni test, and two tests based on the mean and the confidence interval of an empirical Bayes method. Observed patterns were compared to patterns generated from null model randomizations that preserved matrix row and column totals. We evaluated these four methods with random matrices and also with random matrices that had been seeded with an additional segregated or aggregated species pair. The Bayes methods and Bonferroni corrections reduced the frequency of false-positive tests (type I error) in random matrices, but did not always correctly identify the non-random pair in a seeded matrix (type II error). All of the methods were vulnerable to identifying spurious secondary associations in the seeded matrices. When applied to a set of 272 published presence-absence matrices, even the most conservative tests indicated a fourfold increase in the frequency of perfectly segregated "checkerboard" species pairs compared to the null expectation, and a greater predominance of segregated versus aggregated species pairs. The tests did not reveal a large number of significant species pairs in the Vanuatu bird matrix, but in the much smaller Galapagos bird matrix they correctly identified a concentration of segregated species pairs in the genus Geospiza. The Bayesian methods provide for increased selectivity in identifying non-random species pairs, but the analyses will be most powerful if investigators can use a priori biological criteria to identify potential sets of interacting species.},

  Abstract                 = {MacArthur and Wilson's Theory of Island Biogeography (TIB) is among the most well-known process-based explanations for the distribution of species richness. It helps understand the species-area relationship, a fundamental pattern in ecology and an essential tool for conservation. The classic TIB does not, however, account for the complex structure of ecological systems. We extend the TIB to take into account trophic interactions and derive a species-specific model for occurrence probability. We find that the properties of the regional food web influence the species-area relationship, and that, in return, immigration and extinction dynamics affect local food web properties. We compare the accuracy of the classic TIB to our trophic TIB to predict community composition of real food webs and find strong support for our trophic extension of the TIB. Our approach provides a parsimonious explanation to species distributions and open new perspectives to integrate the complexity of ecological interactions into simple species distribution models.},

  abstract =      {Pollinators are required for producing 15‚Äì30{\%} of the human food supply, and farmers rely on managed honey bees throughout the world to provide these services. Yet honey bees are not always the most efficient pollinators of all crops and are declining in various parts of the world. Crop pollination shortages are becoming increasingly common. We found that behavioral interactions between wild and honey bees increase the pollination efficiency of honey bees on hybrid sunflower up to 5-fold, effectively doubling honey bee pollination services on the average field. These indirect contributions caused by interspecific interactions between wild and honey bees were more than five times more important than the contributions wild bees make to sunflower pollination directly. Both proximity to natural habitat and crop planting practices were significantly correlated with pollination services provided directly and indirectly by wild bees. Our results suggest that conserving wild habitat at the landscape scale and altering selected farm management techniques could increase hybrid sunflower production. These findings also demonstrate the economic importance of interspecific interactions for ecosystem services and suggest that protecting wild bee populations can help buffer the human food supply from honey bee shortages.},

  abstract =      {A major current challenge in evolutionary biology is to understand how networks of interacting species shape the coevolutionary process. We combined a model for trait evolution with data for twenty plant-animal assemblages to explore coevolution in mutualistic networks. The results revealed three fundamental aspects of coevolution in species-rich mutualisms. First, coevolution shapes species traits throughout mutualistic networks by speeding up the overall rate of evolution. Second, coevolution results in higher trait complementarity in interacting partners and trait convergence in species in the same trophic level. Third, convergence is higher in the presence of super-generalists, which are species that interact with multiple groups of species. We predict that worldwide shifts in the occurrence of super-generalists will alter how coevolution shapes webs of interacting species. Introduced species such as honeybees will favour trait convergence in invaded communities, whereas the loss of large frugivores will lead to increased trait dissimilarity in tropical ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {Mutualistic networks involving plants and their pollinators or frugivores have been shown recently to exhibit a particular asymmetrical organization of interactions among species called nestedness: a core of reciprocal generalists accompanied by specialist species that interact almost exclusively with generalists. This structure contrasts with compartmentalized assemblage structures that have been verified in antagonistic food webs. Here we evaluated whether nestedness is a property of another type of mutualism‚Äîthe interactions between ants and extrafloral nectary-bearing plants‚Äîand whether species richness may lead to differences in degree of nestedness among biological communities. We investigated network structure in four communities in Mexico. Nested patterns in ant‚Äìplant networks were very similar to those previously reported for pollination and frugivore systems, indicating that this form of asymmetry in specialization is a common feature of mutualisms between free-living species, but not always present in species-poor systems. Other ecological factors also appeared to contribute to the nested asymmetry in specialization, because some assemblages showed more extreme asymmetry than others even when species richness was held constant. Our results support a promising approach for the development of multispecies coevolutionary theory, leading to the idea that specialization may coevolve in different but simple ways in antagonistic and mutualistic assemblages.},

  abstract =      {The structure of mutualistic networks provides clues to processes shaping biodiversity [1-10]. Among them, interaction intimacy, the degree of biological association between partners, leads to differences in specialization patterns [4, 11) and might affect network organization [12]. Here, we investigated potential consequences of interaction intimacy for the structure and coevolution of mutualistic networks. From observed processes of selection on mutualistic interactions, it is expected that symbiotic interactions (high-interaction intimacy) will form species-poor networks characterized by compartmentalization [12,13], whereas nonsymbiotic interactions (low intimacy) will lead to species-rich, nested networks in which there is a core of generalists and specialists often interact with generalists [3, 5, 7,12,14]. We demonstrated an association between interaction intimacy and structure in 19 ant-plant mutualistic networks. Through numerical simulations, we found that network structure of different forms of mutualism affects evolutionary change in distinct ways. Change in one species affects primarily one mutualistic partner in symbiotic interactions but might affect multiple partners in nonsymbiotic interactions. We hypothesize that coevolution in symbiotic interactions is characterized by frequent reciprocal changes between few partners, but coevolution in nonsymbiotic networks might show rare bursts of changes in which many species respond to evolutionary changes in a single species.},

We find that the worldwide air transportation network is a scale-free small-world network. In contrast to the prediction of scale-free network models, however, we find that the most connected cities are not necessarily the most central, resulting in anomalous values of the centrality. We demonstrate that these anomalies arise because of the multicommunity structure of the network. We identify the communities in the air transportation network and show that the community structure cannot be explained solely based on geographical constraints and that geopolitical considerations have to be taken into account. We identify each city's global role based on its pattern of intercommunity and intracommunity connections, which enables us to obtain scale-specific representations of the network.},

When empirical data are available, these estimates may well be obtained from a logistic regression model. Several strategies may be followed in the development of such a model. In this study, the authors compare alternative strategies in 23 small subsamples from a large data set of patients with an acute myocardial infarction, where they developed predictive models for 30-day mortality. Evaluations were performed in an independent part of the data set. Specifically, the authors studied the effect of coding of covariables and stepwise selection on discriminative ability of the resulting model, and the effect of statistical "shrinkage" techniques on calibration. As expected, dichotomization of continuous covariables implied a loss of information. Remarkably, stepwise selection resulted in less discriminating models compared to full models including all available covariables, even when more than half of these were randomly associated with the outcome. Using qualitative information on the sign of the effect of predictors slightly improved the predictive ability. Calibration improved when shrinkage was applied on the standard maximum likelihood estimates of the regression coefficients. In conclusion, a sensible strategy in small data sets is to apply shrinkage methods in full models that include well-coded predictors that are selected based on external information},

  abstractnote = {Conservation practitioners often lack tools to monitor functioning of communities because time and monetary constraints create a gap between the optimal monitoring methods and the practical needs in conservation. Interaction networks provide a framework that has proven useful in ecological research. However, they are considered time consuming and too expensive for conservation purposes. We investigate whether it is possible to sample interaction networks cost-efficiently and whether a compromise exists between data quality and amount of resources required to sample the data by using a highly resolved mutualistic plant-pollinator network sampled over two years in Norway. The dataset was resampled with decreasing sampling intensity to simulate decreasing monitoring costs and we investigated the cost-efficiency of these monitoring regimes. The success in monitoring community structure varied largely with sampling intensity and the descriptor investigated. One major result was that a large proportion of the functionally most important species in the community, both plants and insects, could be identified with relatively little sampling. For example, monitoring only in “peak-season” , which costs ca. 20% relative to full monitoring, resulted in recording of 70% (in 2003) or 85% (in 2004) of the top 20 most functionally important pollinator species. Also, peak-season monitoring resulted in relatively precise estimates of several network descriptors. We present a first estimation of the full cost (travel time, sampling time and taxonomic services) of constructing pollination networks with different sampling effort. We recommend monitoring plant-pollinator networks in temperate regions during peak-season to cost-efficiently collect data for practical habitat management of ecosystem functioning. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Mutualisms require protection from non-reciprocating exploiters. Pseudomyrmex workers that engage in an obligate defensive mutualism with Acacia hosts feed exclusively on the sucrose-free extrafloral nectar (EFN) that is secreted by their hosts, a behaviour linking ant energy supply directly to host performance and thus favouring reciprocating behaviour. We tested the hypothesis that Acacia hosts manipulate this digestive specialisation of their ant mutualists. Invertase (sucrose hydrolytic) activity in the ant midguts was inhibited by chitinase, a dominant EFN protein. The inhibition occurred quickly in cell-free gut liquids and in native gels and thus likely results from an enzyme-enzyme interaction. Once a freshly eclosed worker ingests EFN as the first diet available, her invertase becomes inhibited and she, thus, continues feeding on host-derived EFN. Partner manipulation acts at the phenotypic level and means that one partner actively controls the phenotype of the other partner to enhance its dependency on host-derived rewards.},

The model quantifies the relative suitability of environments for 15 forests classes using the best information that is available: a structural-environmental classification of forest types, vegetation maps and spatial estimates of environmental variables. Inputs to the model include climate variables, soil parent material classes and terrain variables. The model is highly successful at distinguishing the relative suitability of environments for the forest classes with 75{\%} of the forest mosaic accurately predicted by the model at a one hectare resolution over more than two million hectares. The model was used to estimate potential forest distributions in several climates occurring since the end of the last glacial period. These distributions shift dramatically in response to scenarios representing past climates. Certain locations are occupied by a forest class in only some climates while others are always occupied by the same class despite large changes in regional mean annual temperature and precipitation. Using the model to assess the possible impacts of future climate change and estimating the pre-settlement distribution of forest types in the region is also discussed. The coupling of neural networks with a cellular automata model is also described as a means to assess the importance of spatial constraints on the potential redistribution of forest types in the future. The usefulness of artificial neural networks when applied to vegetation change studies in our region suggests that this approach could be applied in many tropical regions, where floristic diversity is high and mechanistic understanding is comparatively low.},

Bee richness and abundance changed with habitat variables and we used this natural variation to test whether complementary resource use by the diverse pollinator community enhanced final yield. We found that pollinator diversity, but not abundance, was positively related to seed set of pumpkins. Bees showed species-specific spatial and temporal variation in flower visitation traits and within-flower behaviour, allowing for classification into functional guilds. Diversity of functional groups explained even more of the variance in seed set (r2=45{\%}) than did species richness (r2=32{\%}) highlighting the role of functional complementarity. Even though we do not provide experimental, but rather correlative evidence, we can link spatial and temporal complementarity in highly diverse pollinator communities to pollination success in the field, leading to enhanced crop yield without any managed honeybees.},

  abstractnote = {1.Eukaryotes commonly host communities of heritable symbiotic bacteria, many of which are not essential for their hosts’ survival and reproduction. There is laboratory evidence that these facultative symbionts can provide useful adaptations, such as increased resistance to natural enemies. However, we do not know how symbionts affect host fitness when the latter are subject to attack by a natural suite of parasites and pathogens. 2.Here we test whether two protective symbionts, Regiella insecticola and Hamiltonella defensa, increase the fitness of their host, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), under natural conditions. 3.We placed experimental populations of two pea aphid lines, each with and without symbionts, in five wet meadow sites to expose them to a natural assembly of enemy species. The aphids were then retrieved and mortality from parasitoids, fungal pathogens and other causes assessed. 4.We found that both Regiella and Hamiltonella reduce the proportion of aphids killed by the specific natural enemies against which they have been shown to protect in laboratory and cage experiments. However, this advantage was nullified (Hamiltonella) or reversed (Regiella) by an increase in mortality from other natural enemies and by the cost of carrying the symbiont. Symbionts therefore affect community structure by altering the relative success of different natural enemies. 5.Our results show that protective symbionts are not necessarily advantageous to their hosts, and may even behave more like parasites than mutualists. Nevertheless, bacterial symbionts may play an important role in determining food web structure and dynamics. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Niche overlap (L) is measured as the degree to which frequency of interspecific encounter is higher or lower than it would be if each species utilized each resource state in proportion to its abundance (a{\_}i). Directional overlap (Z{\_}(xy)) is measured as the density of species Y encountered, on the average, by an individual of species X. When resource states are equal in size, L is equivalent to Lloyd's `interspecies patchiness,' and Z{\_}(x(y)) is equivalent to his `mean crowding on species 1 by species 2.' Indices which in corporate variation in resource state abundance are also developed for mean crowding, patchiness and niche breadth.},

  Abstract                 = {1. A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to understand how the complexity observed in nature can persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. 2. Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: 'traditional' food webs, mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. 3. Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. 4. Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. 5. We conclude by suggesting a number of 'dead ends' and 'fruitful avenues' for future research into ecological networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Declines in pollinator populations may harm biodiversity and agricultural productivity. Little attention has, however, been paid to the systemic response of mutualistic communities to global environmental change. Using a modelling approach and merging network theory with theory on critical transitions, we show that the scale and nature of critical transitions is likely to be influenced by the architecture of mutualistic networks. Specifically, we show that pollinator populations may collapse suddenly once drivers of pollinator decline reach a critical point. A high connectance and/or nestedness of the mutualistic network increases the capacity of pollinator populations to persist under harsh conditions. However, once a tipping point is reached, pollinator populations collapse simultaneously. Recovering from this single community-wide collapse requires a relatively large improvement of conditions. These findings may have large implications for our view on the sustainability of pollinator communities and the services they provide.},

We consider ecological networks subsets of complete food webs involving species at adjacent trophic levels. Reciprocal specializations occur when (say) a pollinator (or group of pollinators) specializes on a particular flower species (or group of such species) and vice versa. Such specializations tend to group species into guilds. We characterize the level of reciprocal specialization for both antagonistic interactions particularly parasitoids and their hosts and mutualistic ones such as insects and the flowers that they pollinate. We also examine whether trophic patterns might be 'palimpsests'2013 that is, there might be reciprocal specialization within taxonomically related species within a network, but these might be obscured when these relationships are combined. Reciprocal specializations are rare in all these systems when tested against the most conservative null model.},

One approach is to derive relatively simple, structural importance indices from network analysis. This assumes that well-connected species are more important. Another approach is to derive functional importance indices using dynamical simulations. We performed both kinds of analysis, and we ranked the species of the Prince William Sound food web based on 13 structural and 5 functional importance indices. We then compared the rank correlation between structural and functional indices. Our results show that different approaches to quantifying importance give different results; unweighted structural indices never correlate significantly with functional ones, but certain weighted structural indices correlate reasonably well with simulated function. This line of research could help in improving our understanding of the usefulness of structural approaches in quantifying the importance of species and understanding biological communities in general. The results strongly indicate the fundamental importance of indirect effects in governing ecosystem dynamics and the need to account for them in structural approaches. Conversely, it generally verifies the usefulness of functional approaches to the investigation of biological communities that account for indirect effects, whether they are modelling or direct empirical studies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstractnote = {nnnn* Sampling ecological interactions presents similar challenges, problems, potential biases, and constraints as sampling individuals and species in biodiversity inventories. Robust estimates of the actual number of interactions (links) within diversified ecological networks require adequate sampling effort that needs to be explicitly gauged. Yet we still lack a sampling theory explicitly focusing on ecological interactions.nnn* While the complete inventory of interactions is likely impossible, a robust characterization of its main patterns and metrics is probably realistic. We must acknowledge that a sizeable fraction of the maximum number of interactions Imax among, say, A animal species and P plant species (i.e., Imax = AP) is impossible to record due to forbidden links, i.e., life-history restrictions. Thus, the number of observed interactions I in robustly sampled networks is typically I << Imax, resulting in sparse interaction matrices with low connectance.nnn* Here I provide a review and outline a conceptual framework for interaction sampling by building an explicit analogue to individuals and species sampling, thus extending diversity-monitoring approaches to the characterization of complex networks of ecological interactions. Contrary to species inventories, a sizable fraction of non-observed pairwise interactions cannot be sampled, due to biological constraints that forbid their occurrence.nnn* Reasons for forbidden links are multiple but mainly stem from spatial and temporal uncoupling, size mismatches, and intrinsically low probabilities of interspecific encounter for most potential interactions of partner species. Adequately assessing the completeness of a network of ecological interactions thus needs knowledge of the natural history details embedded, so that forbidden links can be accounted for as a portion of the unobserved links when addressing sampling effort.nnn* Recent implementations of inference methods for unobserved species or for individual-based data can be combined with the assessment of forbidden links. This can help in estimating their relative importance, simply by the difference between the asymptotic estimate of interaction richness in a robustly-sampled assemblage and the maximum richness Imax of interactions. This is crucial to assess the rapid and devastating effects of defaunationdriven loss of key ecological interactions and the services they provide and the analogous losses related to interaction ga…},

  Abstract                 = {Entropies such as the Shannon-Wiener and Gini-Simpson indices are not themselves diversities. Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, S\o rensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita-Horn index as special cases.},

Network analyses provide insights into the diversity and complexity of ecological interactions and have motivated conclusions about community stability and co-evolution. However, biological traits and mechanisms such as chemical signals regulating the interactions between individual species--the microstructure of a network--are poorly understood. 2. We linked the responses of receivers (flower visitors) towards signals (flower scent) to the structure of a highly diverse natural flower-insect network. For each interaction, we define link temperature--a newly developed metric--as the deviation of the observed interaction strength from neutrality, assuming that animals randomly interact with flowers. 3. Link temperature was positively correlated to the specific visitors' responses to floral scents, experimentally examined in a mobile olfactometer. Thus, communication between plants and consumers via phytochemical signals reflects a significant part of the microstructure in a complex network. Negative as well as positive responses towards floral scents contributed to these results, where individual experience was important apart from innate behaviour. 4. Our results indicate that: (1) biological mechanisms have a profound impact on the microstructure of complex networks that underlies the outcome of aggregate statistics, and (2) floral scents act as a filter, promoting the visitation of some flower visitors, but also inhibiting the visitation of others.},

  Abstract                 = {Plant-pollinator interaction networks are characterized by several features that cannot be obtained from a totally random network (e.g. nestedness, power law distribution of degree specialization, temporal turnover). One reason is that both plants and pollinators are active for only a part of the year, and so a plant species flowering in spring cannot interact with a pollinator species that is active only in autumn. In this paper we build a stochastic model to simulate the plant-pollinator interaction network, taking into account the duration of activity of each species. To build the model we used an empirical plant-pollinator network from a Mediterranean scrub community surveyed over four years. In our simulated annual cycle we know which plant and pollinator species are active, and thus available to interact. We can obtain simulated plant-pollinator interaction networks with properties similar to the real ones in two different ways: (i) by assuming that the frequency distribution of both plant and pollinator duration of activity follow an exponential function, and that interaction among temporally coexisting species are totally random, and (ii) by assuming more realistic frequency distributions (exponential for pollinators, lognormal for plants) and that the interaction among coexisting species is occurring on a per capita basis. In the latter case we assume that there is a positive relationship between abundance and duration of activity. In our model the starting date of the species activity had little influence on the network structure. We conclude that the observed plant-pollinator network properties can be produced stochastically, and the mechanism shaping the network is not necessarily related to size constraints. Under such conditions co-evolutionary explanations should be given with caution.},

One issue is whether pollinator specialization, traditionally thought necessary for floral isolation, is prevalent enough to have played a major role in speciation. Furthermore, the ecological and geographic scenarios under which pollinator transitions occur are poorly understood, and the underlying genetic factors are just beginning to be uncovered for a few systems. Nevertheless, macroevolutionary studies consistently show that transitions to animal pollination are accompanied by an increase in diversification rate. Here we consider several models and diverse empirical data on how pollinators could influence speciation. We conclude that floral isolation is rarely, if ever, sufficient to cause speciation on its own, but that it acts synergistically with other isolating mechanisms. A more comprehensive approach is the key to an improved understanding of the role of pollinators in angiosperm speciation.},

Individual agents diffused on a lattice of cells and interacted according to a set of probabilistic interaction coefficients. Simulations were run on both uniform and non-uniform lattices. The model had two modes: 1. a mean-field mode with global interactions, and 2. a spatially localized mode in which species interacted within local neighborhoods. Equilibrium number of species were compared among different simulations varying web connectance, interaction strength, and lattice heterogeneity. Local interactions resulted in more species rich webs, indicating greater stability. The addition of spatial heterogeneity to the lattice further altered relationships among species richness, web connectance, and interaction strength, and increased coexistence among species. The results did not support the stability criterion derived by May. However, an inverse relationship between web connectance and species richness was observed suggesting that the product of connectance and species richness may govern the stability of real, finite webs.},

By contrast, nursery pollination of certain Caryophyllaceae, including Silene spp., by two nocturnal moth genera, Hadena and Perizoma, ranges from antagonistic to potentially mutualistic, offering an opportunity to test hypotheses about the factors that promote or discourage the evolution of mutualism. Here, we review nursery pollination and host-plant interactions in over 30 caryophyllaceous plants, based on published studies and a survey of researchers investigating pollination, seed predation, and moth morphology and behavior. We detected little direct evidence of mutualism in these moth-plant interactions, but found traits and patterns in both that are nonetheless consistent with the evolution of mutualism and merit further attention.},

  Abstract                 = {There is growing concern that rapid environmental degradation threatens mutualistic interactions. Because mutualisms can bind species to a common fate, mutualism breakdown has the potential to expand and accelerate effects of global change on biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption. The current focus on the ecological dynamics of mutualism under global change has skirted fundamental evolutionary issues. Here, we develop an evolutionary perspective on mutualism breakdown to complement the ecological perspective, by focusing on three processes: (1) shifts from mutualism to antagonism, (2) switches to novel partners and (3) mutualism abandonment. We then identify the evolutionary factors that may make particular classes of mutualisms especially susceptible or resistant to breakdown and discuss how communities harbouring mutualisms may be affected by these evolutionary responses. We propose a template for evolutionary research on mutualism resilience and identify conservation approaches that may help conserve targeted mutualisms in the face of environmental change.},

  abstractnote = {An altitudinal survey of correspondences between fruiting phenologies of fleshy-fruited tree species and seasonal dynamics of frugivorous birds on Mt. Kinabalu in Borneo was carried out for 50 weeks across four vegetation types: a hill forest (800 m asl), a lower montane forest (1700 m), an upper montane forest (2000-3000 m) and a subalpine forest (3000-3500 m). In the hill forest, a large fruiting peak following the general flowering phenomenon was observed during October-November in 1996 and a fruitless period was observed during February-April in 1997. During the fruitless period, the number of resident frugivorous birds decreased. A bimodal fruiting pattern was observed in the lower montane forest. A large number of frugivorous temperate migrants were observed when the fruiting peak occurred. The number of resident frugivorous birds increased and several lowland bird species were observed, when the number of resident birds decreased in the hill forest. In the upper montane forest and the subalpine forest, more continuous and irregular fruiting patterns without outstanding peaks were observed and the number of resident frugivorous birds was more stable throughout the year. These suggested (1) there was a strong relationship between fruiting seasonality and seasonal dynamics of temperate migrants in the lower montane forest; (2) seasonal altitudinal movements of lowland bird species to montane vegetation might occur during the fruitless period in the lowland forest; and (3) the continuous fruiting pattern in the higher vegetation zones might be related to the scarcity of available frugivorous birds. The hypothesis that the influx of temperate migrants into the montane vegetation of Mt. Kinabalu is affected by density and habits of resident frugivorous birds is supported. Montane vegetation in Borneo plays an important role as temporal refugia for temperate and altitudinal migrants by supplying fruit resources.},

Without adaptive foragers, food-web complexity destabilizes community composition; whereas in their presence, complexity may enhance community persistence through facilitation of dynamical food-web reconstruction that buffers environmental fluctuations.

Most networks are modular, with modules being distinct species subsets connected mainly with each other and having few connections to other modules. We investigate the phylogenetic relatedness of species within modules and whether a phylogenetic signal is detectable in the within- and among-module connectivity of species using 27 mammal-flea networks from the Palaearctic. In the 24 networks that were modular, closely related hosts co-occurred in the same module more often than expected by chance; in contrast, this was rarely the case for parasites. The within- and among-module connectivity of the same host or parasite species varied geographically. However, among-module but not within-module connectivity of host and parasites was somewhat phylogenetically constrained. These findings suggest that the establishment of host-parasite networks results from the interplay between phylogenetic influences acting mostly on hosts and local factors acting on parasites, to create an asymmetrically constrained pattern of geographic variation in modular structure. Modularity in host-parasite networks seems to result from the shared evolutionary history of hosts and by trait convergence among unrelated parasites. This suggests profound differences between hosts and parasites in the establishment and functioning of bipartite antagonistic networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Opportunistic parasite species, capable of exploiting several different host species, do not achieve the same abundance on all these hosts. Parasites achieve maximum abundance on their principal host species, and lower abundances on their auxiliary host species. Taxonomic relatedness between the principal and auxiliary host species may determine what abundance a parasite can achieve on its auxiliary hosts, as relatedness should reflect similarities among host species in ecological, physiological and/or immunological characters. We tested this hypothesis with fleas (Siphonaptera) parasitic on small Holarctic mammals. We determined whether the abundance of a flea in its auxiliary hosts decreases with increasing taxonomic distance of these hosts from the principal host. Using data on 106 flea species from 23 regions, for a total of 194 flea-locality combinations, we found consistent support for this relationship, both within and across regions, and even after controlling for the potentially confounding effect of flea phylogeny. These results are most likely explained by a decrease in the efficiency of the parasite's evasive mechanisms against the host's behavioural and immune defences with increasing taxonomic distance from the principal host. Our findings suggest that host switching over evolutionary time may be severely constrained by the coupling of parasite success with the relatedness between new hosts and the original host.},

Theoretically, compartments increase the stability in networks, such as food webs. Compartments have been difficult to detect in empirical food webs because of incompatible approaches or insufficient methodological rigour. Here we show that a method for detecting compartments from the social networking science identified significant compartments in three of five complex, empirical food webs. Detection of compartments was influenced by food web resolution, such as interactions with weights. Because the method identifies compartmental boundaries in which interactions are concentrated, it is compatible with the definition of compartments. The method is rigorous because it maximizes an explicit function, identifies the number of non-overlapping compartments, assigns membership to compartments, and tests the statistical significance of the results. A graphical presentation reveals systemic relationships and taxa-specific positions as structured by compartments. From this graphic, we explore two scenarios of disturbance to develop a hypothesis for testing how compartmentalized interactions increase stability in food webs.},

  Abstract                 = {Many ecosystem services are delivered by organisms that depend on habitats that are segregated spatially or temporally from the location where services are provided. Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile-agent-based ecosystem service (MABES), pollination, is affected by land-use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal-mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service-providing organisms depend. About one-third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60-90\% of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market-based forces to influence land-use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying knowledge gaps, determining research priorities, and targeting interventions that can be applied in an adaptive management context.},

  abstract      = {In QSAR studies of large data sets, variable selection and model building is a difficult, time-consuming and ambiguous procedure. While most often stepwise regression procedures are applied for this purpose, other strategies, like neural networks, cluster significance analysis or genetic algorithms have been used. A simple and efficient evolutionary strategy, including iterative mutation and selection, but avoiding crossover of regression models, is described in this work. The MUSEUM (Mutation and Selection Uncover Models) algorithm starts from a model containing any number of randomly chosen variables. Random mutation, first by addition or elimination of only one or very few variables, afterwards by simultaneous random additions, eliminations and/or ex changes of several variables at a time, leads to new models which are evaluated by an appropriate fitness function. In contrast to common genetic algorithm procedures, only the ‚Äùfittest‚Äù model is stored and used for further mutation and selection, leading to better and better models. In the last steps of mutation, all variables inside the model are eliminated and all variables outside the model are added, one by one, to control whether this systematic strategy detects any mutation which still improves the model. After every generation of a better model, a new random mutation procedure starts from this model. In the very last step, variables not significant at the 95{\%} level are eliminated, starting with the least significant variable. In this manner, ‚Äùstable‚Äù models are produced, containing only significant variables. A comparison of the results for the Selwood data set (n = 31 compounds, k = 53 variables) with those obtained by other groups shows that more relevant models are derived by the evolutionary approach than by other methods},

  Abstract                 = {The pollination syndrome hypothesis has provided a major conceptual framework for how plants and pollinators interact. However, the assumption of specialization in pollination systems and the reliability of floral traits in predicting the main pollinators have been questioned recently. In addition, the relationship between ecological and evolutionary specialization in pollination interactions is still poorly understood. We used data of 62 plant species from three communities across southern Norway to test: (1) the relationships between floral traits and the identity of pollinators, (2) the association between floral traits (evolutionary specialization) and ecological generalization, and (3) the consistency of both relationships across communities. Floral traits significantly affected the identity of pollinators in the three communities in a way consistent with the predictions derived from the pollination syndrome concept. However, hover flies and butterflies visited flowers with different shapes in different communities, which we mainly attribute to among-community variation in pollinator assemblages. Interestingly, ecological generalization depended more on the community-context (i.e. the plant and pollinator assemblages in the communities) than on specific floral traits. While open yellow and white flowers were the most generalist in two communities, they were the most specialist in the alpine community. Our results warn against the use of single measures of ecological generalization to question the pollination syndrome concept, and highlight the importance of community comparisons to assess the pollination syndromes, and to understand the relationships between ecological and evolutionary specialization in plant-pollinator interactions.},

They have been shown to be universal and highly flexible function approximators for any data. These make powerful tools for models, especially when the underlying data relationships are unknown. In this reason, the international workshop on the applications of ANNs to ecological modelling was organized in Toulouse, France (December 1998). During this meeting, we discussed different methods, and their reliability to deal with ecological data. The special issue of this ecological modelling journal begins with the state-of-the-art with emphasis on the development of structural dynamic models presented by S.E. Jorgensen (DK). Then, to illustrate the ecological applications of ANNs, examples are drawn from several fields, e.g. terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, remote sensing and evolutionary ecology. In this paper, we present some of the most important papers of the first workshop about ANNs in ecological modelling. We briefly introduce here two algorithms frequently used; (i) one supervised network, the backpropagation algorithm; and (ii) one unsupervised network, the Kohonen self-organizing mapping algorithm. The future development of ANNs is discussed in the present work. Several examples of modelling of ANNs in various areas of ecology are presented in this special issue.},

  abstract      = {The selection of the most relevant variable is a frequent problem in the analysis of chemical data, especially now considering the large amounts of data created by the increased computer power and analytical resolution. A novel procedure for variable selection based on multiregression (MR) analysis is developed and applied to the quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling of gas chromatographic retention times t(R) and Dietz response factors RF on 152 diverse chemical compounds. Using 296 descriptors generated by the CODESSA program, "absolutely the best" linear MR models containing from 1 to 5 descriptors were first selected (similar to 2 x 10(10) models were checked), and then "the best" linear stepwise MR models with six and seven descriptors were obtained through "i by i" stepwise selection. In this paper i was varied from 1 to 4, so that in each next step i descriptors were added to the previously selected descriptors. Nonlinear models were developed by the inclusion of cross-products of initial descriptors. We selected as the most important descriptors for tR the number of C-H and C-X bonds, connectivity indices of order 3, the highest normal mode vibrational frequency, and the rotational entropy of the molecule at 300 K. In the case of RF modeling the most important descriptors are those related to the relative number and weight of effective C atoms, the orbital electronic population, and the bond order and valency of C and II atoms. Comparison with the best six-descriptor models obtained by the normal CODESSA procedure shows that nonlinear seven-descriptor MR models now obtained achieve 30{\%} (0.3520 vs 0.5032) and 12{\%} (0.0472 vs 0.0530) less standard errors of estimate for tR and RF, respectively. Our novel procedure of selecting a small number of the most important descriptors from a data set allows us to extract a larger amount of useful information than with the procedure implemented in CODESSA. Thus, our new procedure enables the selection of the best possible MR models from 1010 possibilities. Through the introduction of cross-product terms, we obtained nonlinear MR models which are superior to the corresponding linear models},

  Abstract                 = {The impact of coevolutionary interaction between species on adaptive radiation processes is analysed with reference to pollination biology case studies. Occasional colonization of archipelagos can bring together coevolving partners and cause coradiation of the colonizing species, e.g. the drepanidids and the lobelioids on Hawaii. Permanent reciprocal selective pressure between pairs of coevolving species can lead to a coevolutionary race and rapid evolutionary change. This is exemplified by spurred flowers and long-tongued flower-visitors. The geographic patterning of diffuse coevolution systems can lead to dramatic changes in species interactions. In different populations, interaction between pollinating and seed-parasitizing Greya moths and their host plants varies from mutualism to commensalism and antagonism, depending on the presence of copollinators. Asymmetrical coevolution between angiosperms and oligolectic flower-visitors may facilitate rapid reproductive isolation of populations following a food-plant switch, if the oligoleges use their specific food plants as the rendezvous sites. Diffuse coevolution between angiosperm species and pollinating insects may cause frequent convergent evolution of floral traits such as nectar reward instead of pollen reward, floral guides, zygomorphic flowers, or mimicry of pollen signals, since the multiple plant species experience similar selective pressures via the coevolving partners. Patterns of angiosperm adaptive radiation are highlighted in the context of coevolution with pollinators. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {1. A quantitative parasitoid web was constructed describing the trophic relationships between the community of aphids, parasitoids and secondary parasitoids in an abandoned field in southern England. Root aphids were omitted and secondary parasitoids were associated with aphids rather than primary parasitoids. All aphids, parasitoids and trophic links were expressed in the same units (m-2). Over a 2-year period, separate webs were constructed for every month that aphids and parasitoids were active in the field. 2. Twenty-six species of plants were attacked by 25 species of aphid which were parasitized by 18 species of primary parasitoids. The primary parasitoids were attacked by 28 species of secondary parasitoids, of which 18 directly attacked the still living aphid (hyperparasitoids) and 10 attacked the aphid after mummification (mummy parasitoids). The aphids were attended by three species of ants. 3. Eleven webs were constructed for the months May to September 1994 and May to October 1995. Aphids and primary parasitoids were most abundant and diverse in June, and secondary parasitoids one month later. 4. The ratios of the number of aphid species to the number of species of primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were relatively constant across webs, as was the ratio of the number of links involving hyperparasitoids and mummy parasitoids. The ratio of the total number of links to the total number of species increased with web size. 5. The relative abundance of the species in the different webs was well described by a Dirichlet distribution with a common parameter. This implies a gamma distribution of aphid abundances in the field with few common and many rare species. 6. Predator (i.e. parasitoid) overlap graphs were constructed to assess the potential for indirect interactions between aphids. Mummy parasitoids were the most important group linking different aphids. A quantitative overlap diagram was developed to illustrate the potential strengths of indirect linkages. Common aphid species shared few strong, indirect links via primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids, but could be strongly linked by mummy parasitoids. Symmetrical links were uncommon, and rare species were potentially strongly influenced by the presence of common aphids with which they shared parasitoids. 7. Ant-attended aphids were attacked by fewer species of primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids than those species not attended by ants. Species of mummy parasitoids attack, on average, approximately twice the number of host species than species of either primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids.},

  Abstract                 = {Characterizing the architecture of bipartite networks is increasingly used as a framework to study biotic interactions within their ecological context and to assess the extent to which evolutionary constraint shape them. Orchid mycorrhizal symbioses are particularly interesting as they are viewed as more beneficial for plants than for fungi, a situation expected to result in an asymmetry of biological constraint. This study addressed the architecture and phylogenetic constraint in these associations in tropical context. We identified a bipartite network including 73 orchid species and 95 taxonomic units of mycorrhizal fungi across the natural habitats of Reunion Island. Unlike some recent evidence for nestedness in mycorrhizal symbioses, we found a highly modular architecture that largely reflected an ecological barrier between epiphytic and terrestrial subnetworks. By testing for phylogenetic signal, the overall signal was stronger for both partners in the epiphytic subnetwork. Moreover, in the subnetwork of epiphytic angraecoid orchids, the signal in orchid phylogeny was stronger than the signal in fungal phylogeny. Epiphytic associations are therefore more conservative and may co-evolve more than terrestrial ones. We suggest that such tighter phylogenetic specialization may have been driven by stressful life conditions in the epiphytic niches. In addition to paralleling recent insights into mycorrhizal networks, this study furthermore provides support for epiphytism as a major factor affecting ecological assemblage and evolutionary constraint in tropical mycorrhizal symbioses.},

  Abstract                 = {Grazing optimization occurs when herbivory increases primary production at low grazing intensities. In the case of simple plant-herbivore interactions, such an effect can result from recycling of a limiting nutrient. However, in more complex cases, herbivory can also lead to species replacement in plant communities, which in turn alters how primary production is affected by herbivory. Here we explore this issue using a model of a limiting nutrient cycle in an ecosystem with two plant species. We show that two major plant traits determine primary production at equilibrium: plant recycling efficiency (i.e., the fraction of the plant nutrient stock that stays within the ecosystem until it is returned to the nutrient pool in mineral form) and plant ability to deplete the soil mineral nutrient pool through consumption of this resource. In cases where sufficient time has occurred, grazing optimization requires that herbivory improve nutrient conservation in the system sufficiently. This condition sets a minimum threshold for herbivore nutrient recycling efficiency, the fraction of nutrient consumed by herbivores that is recycled within the ecosystem to the mineral nutrient pool. This threshold changes with plant community composition and herbivore preference and is, therefore, strongly affected by plant species replacement. The quantitative effects of these processes on grazing optimization are determined by both the recycling efficiencies and depletion abilities of the plant species. However, grazing optimization remains qualitatively possible even with plant species replacement.},

This could include a dynamics for the introduction and deletion of constituents and for the changing of interaction strengths depending on the states of the local constituents. In the case of food webs, where the constituents are species and the interactions are predator-prey relationships, this involves going beyond conventional population dynamics to include mechanisms which allow for the introduction and extinction of species and changing of feeding preferences. We review a model of food web evolution which we have been involved in developing over the last few years which encapsulates},

Despite this, little is known about how food webs respond to regular variation in time, such as occurs broadly with season. We argue that season, and likely any periodicity, structures food webs along a temporal axis in an analogous way to that previously recognized in space; predators shift their diet as different resource compartments and trophic levels become available through time. These characteristics are likely (i) central to ecosystem function and stability based on theory, and (ii) widespread across ecosystem types based on empirical observations. The temporal food web perspective outlined here could provide new insight into the ecosystem-level consequences of altered abiotic and biotic processes that might accompany globally changing environments.},

  abstractnote = {In networks of plant-animal mutualisms, different animal groups interact preferentially with different plants, thus forming distinct modules responsible for different parts of the service. However, what we currently know about seed dispersal networks is based only on birds. Therefore, we wished to fill this gap by studying bat-fruit networks and testing how they differ from bird-fruit networks. As dietary overlap of Neotropical bats and birds is low, they should form distinct mutualistic modules within local networks. Furthermore, since frugivory evolved only once among Neotropical bats, but several times independently among Neotropical birds, greater dietary overlap is expected among bats, and thus connectance and nestedness should be higher in bat-fruit networks. If bat-fruit networks have higher nestedness and connectance, they should be more robust to extinctions. We analyzed 1 mixed network of both bats and birds and 20 networks that consisted exclusively of either bats (11) or birds (9). As expected, the structure of the mixed network was both modular (M = 0.45) and nested (NODF = 0.31); one module contained only birds and two only bats. In 20 datasets with only one disperser group, bat-fruit networks (NODF = 0.53 ± 0.09, C = 0.30 ± 0.11) were more nested and had a higher connectance than bird-fruit networks (NODF = 0.42 ± 0.07, C = 0.22 ± 0.09). Unexpectedly, robustness to extinction of animal species was higher in bird-fruit networks (R = 0.60 ± 0.13) than in bat-fruit networks (R = 0.54 ± 0.09), and differences were explained mainly by species richness. These findings suggest that a modular structure also occurs in seed dispersal networks, similar to pollination networks. The higher nestedness and connectance observed in bat-fruit networks compared with bird-fruit networks may be explained by the monophyletic evolution of frugivory in Neotropical bats, among which the diets of specialists seem to have evolved from the pool of fruits consumed by generalists.},

  Abstract                 = {Mutually beneficial interactions between flowering plants and animal pollinators represent a critical 'ecosystem service' under threat of anthropogenic extinction. We explored probable patterns of extinction in two large networks of plants and flower visitors by simulating the removal of pollinators and consequent loss of the plants that depend upon them for reproduction. For each network, we removed pollinators at random, systematically from least-linked (most specialized) to most-linked (most generalized), and systematically from most- to least-linked. Plant species diversity declined most rapidly with preferential removal of the most-linked pollinators, but declines were no worse than linear. This relative tolerance to extinction derives from redundancy in pollinators per plant and from nested topology of the networks. Tolerance in pollination networks contrasts with catastrophic declines reported from standard food webs. The discrepancy may be a result of the method used: previous studies removed species from multiple trophic levels based only on their linkage, whereas our preferential removal of pollinators reflects their greater risk of extinction relative to that of plants. In both pollination networks, the most-linked pollinators were bumble-bees and some solitary bees. These animals should receive special attention in efforts to conserve temperate pollination systems.},

To uncover their structural design principles, we defined “network motifs,” patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Co-flowering plant species frequently share pollinators. Pollinator sharing is often detrimental to one or more of these species, leading to competition for pollination. Perhaps because it offers an intriguing juxtaposition of ecological opposites - mutualism and competition - within one relatively tractable system, competition for pollination has captured the interest of ecologists for over a century. SCOPE: Our intent is to contemplate exciting areas for further work on competition for pollination, rather than to exhaustively review past studies. After a brief historical summary, we present a conceptual framework that incorporates many aspects of competition for pollination, involving both the quantity and quality of pollination services, and both female and male sex functions of flowers. Using this framework, we contemplate a relatively subtle mechanism of competition involving pollen loss, and consider how competition might affect plant mating systems, overall reproductive success and multi-species interactions. We next consider how competition for pollination might be altered by several emerging consequences of a changing planet, including the spread of alien species, climate change and pollinator declines. Most of these topics represent new frontiers whose exploration has just begun. CONCLUSIONS: Competition for pollination has served as a model for the integration of ecological and evolutionary perspectives in the study of species interactions. Its study has elucidated both obvious and more subtle mechanisms, and has documented a range of outcomes. However, the potential for this interaction to inform our understanding of both pure and applied aspects of pollination biology has only begun to be realized.},

We investigate the preliminary impact of translocating three threatened plant species on insect species and the integrity of insect assemblages that depend on these plants as their hosts. We compare the insect assemblages between natural populations of the threatened species, related non-threatened plant species growing wild near the threatened plants, and threatened plants translocated to another site approximately 40 km away. We used host breadth models and a coextinction risk protocol to determine which insect species are potentially host-specific on the threatened plants, and then assessed these insects’ potential presence at the translocation site. We found that insect assemblages on naturally-occurring threatened plants had more individuals, higher species density and higher species richness than assemblages on translocated plants. For one plant species, , species composition differed significantly between wild and translocated populations ( < 0.001). Furthermore, four insect species that were host-specific to and were not detected on the translocated plants. Instead, translocated plants supported insect assemblages more similar to those of related plant species from the surrounding area. We conclude that threatened plant translocations that involve seed collection and propagation may have limited benefit for individual dependent species or the supported insect assemblage. Additional conservation actions will be required to maintain the diversity of insect assemblages and host-dependent relationships.},

Inexpensive maps can be produced by modelling forest class and structure variables collected in nationwide forest inventories as functions of satellite-based information. But little work has been directed at comparing modelling techniques to determine which tools are best suited to mapping tasks given multiple objectives and logistical constraints. Consequently, five modelling techniques were compared for mapping forest characteristics in the Interior Western United States. The modelling techniques included linear models (LMs), generalized additive models (GAMs), classification and regression trees (CARTs), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Models were built for two discrete and four continuous forest response variables using a variety of satellite-based predictor variables within each of five ecologically different regions. All techniques proved themselves workable in an automated environment. When their potential mapping ability was explored through simulations, tremendous advantages were seen in use of MARS and ANN for prediction over LMs, GAMs, and CART. However, much smaller differences were seen when using real data. In some instances, a simple linear approach worked virtually as well as the more complex models, while small gains were seen using more complex models in other instances. In real data runs, MARS and GAMS performed (marginally) best for prediction of forest characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {Plants with poorly attractive flowers or with little floral rewards may have inadequate pollinator service, which in turn reduces seed output. However, pollinator service of less attractive species could be enhanced when they are associated with species with highly attractive flowers (so called 'magnet-species'). Although several studies have reported the magnet species effect, few of them have evaluated whether this positive interaction result in an enhancement of the seed output for the beneficiary species. Here, we compared pollinator visitation rates and seed output of the invasive annual species Carduus pycnocephalus when grow associated with shrubs of the invasive Lupinus arboreus and when grow alone, and hypothesized that L. arboreus acts as a magnet species for C. pycnocephalus. Results showed that C. pycnocephalus individuals associated with L. arboreus had higher pollinator visitation rates and higher seed output than individuals growing alone. The higher visitation rates of C. pycnocephalus associated to L. arboreus were maintained after accounting for flower density, which consistently supports our hypothesis on the magnet species effect of L. arboreus. Given that both species are invasives, the facilitated pollination and reproduction of C. pycnocephalus by L. arboreus could promote its naturalization in the community, suggesting a synergistic invasional process contributing to an 'invasional meltdown'. The magnet effect of Lupinus on Carduus found in this study seems to be one the first examples of indirect facilitative interactions via increased pollination among invasive species.},

  Abstract                 = {Darwin used the metaphor of a 'tangled bank' to describe the complex interactions between species. Those interactions are varied: they can be antagonistic ones involving predation, herbivory and parasitism, or mutualistic ones, such as those involving the pollination of flowers by insects. Moreover, the metaphor hints that the interactions may be complex to the point of being impossible to understand. All interactions can be visualized as ecological networks, in which species are linked together, either directly or indirectly through intermediate species. Ecological networks, although complex, have well defined patterns that both illuminate the ecological mechanisms underlying them and promise a better understanding of the relationship between complexity and ecological stability.},

  Abstract                 = {A community is "nested" when species assemblages in less rich sites form nonrandom subsets of those at richer sites. Conventional null models used to test for statistically nonrandom nestedness are under- or over-restrictive because they do not sufficiently isolate ecological processes of interest, which hinders ecological inference. We propose a class of null models that are ecologically explicit and interpretable. Expected values of species richness and incidence, rather than observed values, are used to create random presence-absence matrices for hypothesis testing. In our examples, based on six datasets, expected values were derived either by using an individually based random placement model or by fitting empirical models to richness data as a function of environmental covariates. We describe an algorithm for constructing unbiased null matrices, which permitted valid testing of our null models. Our approach avoids the problem of building too much structure into the null model, and enabled us to explicitly test whether observed communities were more nested than would be expected for a system structured solely by species-abundance and species-area or similar relationships. We argue that this test or similar tests are better determinants of whether a system is truly nested; a nested system should contain unique pattern not already predicted by more fundamental ecological principles such as species-area relationships. Most species assemblages we studied were not nested under these null models. Our results suggest that nestedness, beyond that which is explained by passive sampling processes, may not be as widespread as currently believed. These findings may help to improve the utility of nestedness as an ecological concept and conservation tool.},

  Abstract                 = {Competition has been widely discussed as a process that may structure communities of plants and animals. Its role in insect communities is less clear, especially as many insect species do not appear to compete for resources. However, such communities could still be structured by “apparent competition” where the species interact through shared natural enemies. We explore recent attempts to assess whether apparent com- petition may structure herbivorous insect communities. Communities can be described by quantitative food webs from which the potential for apparent competition can be inferred. We illustrate both the construction of a diverse quantitative food web and a field experimental test of apparent competition using our work on leaf-miner commu- nities in Belize. We consider how a spatial perspective may be incorporated into our leaf-miner community research, and speculate about the shape of apparent competition kernels and their relevance for the structure of herbivorous insect communities.},

  Abstract                 = {Mutualisms provide benefits to interacting species, but they also involve costs. If costs come to exceed benefits as population density or the frequency of encounters between species increases, the interaction will no longer be mutualistic. Thus curves that represent benefits and costs as functions of interaction frequency are important tools for predicting when a mutualism will tip over into antagonism. Currently, most of what we know about benefit and cost curves in pollination mutualisms comes from highly specialized pollinating seed–consumer mutualisms, such as the yucca moth–yucca interaction. There, benefits to female reproduction saturate as the number of visits to a flower increases (because the amount of pollen needed to fertilize all the flower’s ovules is finite), but costs continue to increase (because pollinator offspring consume developing seeds), leading to a peak in seed production at an intermediate number of visits. But for most plant–pollinator mutualisms, costs to the plant are more subtle than consumption of seeds, and how such costs scale with interaction frequency remains largely unknown. Here, we present reasonable benefit and cost curves that are appropriate for typical pollinator–plant interactions, and we show how they can result in a wide diversity of relationships between net benefit (benefit minus cost) and interaction frequency. We then use maximum-likelihood methods to fit net-benefit curves to measures of female reproductive success for three typical pollination mutualisms from two continents, and for each system we chose the most parsimonious model using information-criterion statistics. We discuss the implications of the shape of the net-benefit curve for the ecology and evolution of plant–pollinator mutualisms, as well as the challenges that lie ahead for disentangling the underlying benefit and cost curves for typical pollination mutualisms.},

  Abstract                 = {1 Habitat fragmentation and the resulting decline in the local abundance of plant species can affect biological interactions. We examined the effects of abundance on plant-pollinator interactions by observing the pollinator service and subsequent reproductive output of a mostly outbreeding, but self-compatible, plant, Lychnis viscaria, in experimental populations of different sizes (number of individuals) and densities (distance between individuals). 2 Bumblebees, the main pollinators of L. viscaria, preferred larger populations, but visitation rates were higher in sparser populations. Pollinators were attracted to the larger inflorescences in sparse populations, which were also more visible due to their larger area for a given size. 3 Bumblebees probed more flowers within plants in sparse populations, probably due to the larger inflorescences and longer flight distances between individuals. 4 Subsequent reproductive success (capsule production) was higher in sparse populations, due to differences in pollination success and resource competition, and their interaction. In self-compatible species, such as L. viscaria, reproductive success may be determined more by resource availability, whereas self-incompatible plants may be more sensitive to changes in pollinator abundance. 5 We conclude that plant-pollinator interactions are sensitive to changes in both the size and spatial arrangement of plant populations, which can affect their demography and genetics. In this study, species density had a greater effect than size and the unexpectedly beneficial effects of low density may be due to greater resource availability.},

We analyse the role of recycling, predation and competition and find that ecosystem stability can be estimated by the strengths of the shortest positive and negative predator-prey feedbacks in the network. We show the generality of our explanation with another 21 observed food webs, comparing random-type parameterisations of interaction strengths with empirical ones. Our results show how functional relationships dominate over average-network topology. They make clear that the classic complexity-instability paradox is essentially an artificial interaction-strength result.},

To be nested, a network must consist of a core group of generalists all interacting with each other, and with extreme specialists interacting only with generalist species. 2. Studies on ecological networks are especially prone to sampling effects, as they involve entire species assemblages. However, we know of no study addressing to what extent nestedness depends on sampling effort, despite the numerous studies discussing the ecological and evolutionary implications of nested networks. 3. Here we manipulate sampling effort in time and space and show that nestedness is less sensitive to sampling effort than number of species and links within the network. 4. That a structural property of an ecological network appears less prone to sampling bias is encouraging for other studies of ecological networks. This is because it indicates that the sensitivity of ecological networks properties to effects of sampling effort might be smaller than previously expected.},

According to the classic escape-and-radiate (EAR) hypothesis, these hyperdiverse communities result from coevolutionary arms races consisting of successive cycles of enemy escape, radiation, and colonization by new enemy lineages. It has also been suggested that "enemy-free space" provided by novel host plants could promote host shifts by herbivores, and that parasitoids could similarly drive diversification of gall form in insects that induce galls on plants. Because these central coevolutionary hypotheses have never been tested in a phylogenetic framework, we combined phylogenetic information on willow-galling sawflies with data on their host plants, gall types, and enemy communities.},

We show, by way of theoretical analyses with empirically informed parameters, that structural properties can alter the stability of mutualistic communities characterized by nonlinear functional responses among the interacting species. Specifically, community resilience is enhanced by increasing community size (species diversity) and the number of species interactions (connectivity), and through strong, symmetric interaction strengths of highly nested networks. As a result, mutualistic communities show largely positive complexity-stability relationships, in opposition to the standard paradox. Thus, contrary to the commonly-held belief that mutualism's positive feedback destabilizes food webs, our results suggest that interplay between the structure and function of ecological networks in general, and consideration of mutualistic interactions in particular, may be key to understanding complexity-stability relationships of biological communities as a whole.},

In a 1-mode pollinator network, two pollinator species are linked to each other if they both visit the same plant species, and vice versa for plants. Properties of 2-mode networks and their derived 1-mode networks are highly correlated and so are properties of 1-mode pollinator and 1-mode plant networks. Most network properties are scale-dependent, i.e. they are dependent upon network size. Pollination networks have the strongest small-world properties of any networks yet studied, i.e. all species are close to each other (short average path length) and species are highly clustered. Species in pollination networks are much more densely linked than species in traditional food webs, i.e. they have a higher density of links, a shorter distance between species, and species are more clustered.},

  Abstract                 = {In natural communities, species and their interactions are often organized as nonrandom networks, showing distinct and repeated complex patterns. A prevalent, but poorly explored pattern is ecological modularity, with weakly interlinked subsets of species (modules), which, however, internally consist of strongly connected species. The importance of modularity has been discussed for a long time, but no consensus on its prevalence in ecological networks has yet been reached. Progress is hampered by inadequate methods and a lack of large datasets. We analyzed 51 pollination networks including almost 10,000 species and 20,000 links and tested for modularity by using a recently developed simulated annealing algorithm. All networks with >150 plant and pollinator species were modular, whereas networks with <50 species were never modular. Both module number and size increased with species number. Each module includes one or a few species groups with convergent trait sets that may be considered as coevolutionary units. Species played different roles with respect to modularity. However, only 15\% of all species were structurally important to their network. They were either hubs (i.e., highly linked species within their own module), connectors linking different modules, or both. If these key species go extinct, modules and networks may break apart and initiate cascades of extinction. Thus, species serving as hubs and connectors should receive high conservation priorities.},

Yet, understanding network dynamics is important in order to relate network patterns to ecological processes. We studied the day-to-day dynamics of an arctic pollination interaction network over two consecutive seasons. First, we found that new species entering the network tend to interact with already well-connected species, although there are deviations from this trend due, for example, to morphological mismatching between plant and pollinator traits and nonoverlapping phenophases of plant and pollinator species. Thus, temporal dynamics provides a mechanistic explanation for previously reported network patterns such as the heterogeneous distribution of number of interactions across species. Second, we looked for the ecological properties most likely to be mediating this dynamical process and found that both abundance and phenophase length were important determinants of the number of links per species.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent reviews of plant‚Äìpollinator mutualistic networks showed that generalization is a common pattern in this type of interaction. Here we examine the ecological correlates of generalization patterns in plant‚Äìpollinator networks, especially how interaction patterns covary with latitude, elevation, and insularity. We review the few published analyses of whole networks and include unpublished material, analyzing 29 complete plant‚Äì pollinator networks that encompass arctic, alpine, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical‚Äìtropical areas. The number of interactions observed (I) was a linear function of network size (M) the maximum number of interactions: ln I = 0.575 + 0.61 lnM; R2 = 0.946. The connectance (C), the fraction of observed interactions relative to the total possible, decreased exponentially with species richness, the sum of animal and plant species in each community (A + P): C = 13.83 exp[-0.003(A + P)]. After controlling for species richness, the residual connectance was significantly lower in highland (>1500 m elevation) than in lowland networks and differed marginally among biogeographic regions, with both alpine and tropical networks showing a trend for lower residual connectance. The two Mediterranean networks showed the highest residual connectance. After correcting for variation in network size, plant species were shown to be more generalized at higher latitude and lowland habitats, but showed increased specialization on islands. Oceanic island networks showed an impoverishment of potential animal pollinators (lower ratio of animal to plant species, A : P, compared to mainland networks) associated with this trend of increased specialization. Plants, but not their flower-visiting animals, supported the often-repeated statements about higher specificity in the tropics than at higher latitudes. The pattern of interaction buildup as diversity increases in pollination networks does not differ appreciably from other mutualisms, such as plant‚Äìseed disperser networks or more complex food webs.},

  Abstract                 = {In ecosystems, species interact with other species directly and through abiotic factors in multiple ways, often forming complex networks of various types of ecological interaction. Out of this suite of interactions, predator-prey interactions have received most attention. The resulting food webs, however, will always operate simultaneously with networks based on other types of ecological interaction, such as through the activities of ecosystem engineers or mutualistic interactions. Little is known about how to classify, organize and quantify these other ecological networks and their mutual interplay. The aim of this paper is to provide new and testable ideas on how to understand and model ecosystems in which many different types of ecological interaction operate simultaneously. We approach this problem by first identifying six main types of interaction that operate within ecosystems, of which food web interactions are one. Then, we propose that food webs are structured among two main axes of organization: a vertical (classic) axis representing trophic position and a new horizontal 'ecological stoichiometry' axis representing decreasing palatability of plant parts and detritus for herbivores and detrivores and slower turnover times. The usefulness of these new ideas is then explored with three very different ecosystems as test cases: temperate intertidal mudflats; temperate short grass prairie; and tropical savannah.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: 'Pollination syndromes' are suites of phenotypic traits hypothesized to reflect convergent adaptations of flowers for pollination by specific types of animals. They were first developed in the 1870s and honed during the mid 20th Century. In spite of this long history and their central role in organizing research on plant-pollinator interactions, the pollination syndromes have rarely been subjected to test. The syndromes were tested here by asking whether they successfully capture patterns of covariance of floral traits and predict the most common pollinators of flowers. METHODS: Flowers in six communities from three continents were scored for expression of floral traits used in published descriptions of the pollination syndromes, and simultaneously the pollinators of as many species as possible were characterized. KEY RESULTS: Ordination of flowers in a multivariate 'phenotype space' defined by the syndromes showed that almost no plant species fall within the discrete syndrome clusters. Furthermore, in approximately two-thirds of plant species, the most common pollinator could not be successfully predicted by assuming that each plant species belongs to the syndrome closest to it in phenotype space. CONCLUSIONS: The pollination syndrome hypothesis as usually articulated does not successfully describe the diversity of floral phenotypes or predict the pollinators of most plant species. Caution is suggested when using pollination syndromes for organizing floral diversity, or for inferring agents of floral adaptation. A fresh look at how traits of flowers and pollinators relate to visitation and pollen transfer is recommended, in order to determine whether axes can be identified that describe floral functional diversity more successfully than the traditional syndromes.},

We assess the different meanings of generalist flowers with respect to the ecological “set and setting” of pollination, and then we discuss notions of ecological, functional and phenotypic gener- alization. These ideas are explored in more detail using examples from our own published and unpublished studies on the pollination ecology of Daucus carota, Hedera helix, and Chamerion angustifolium, and from the published work of other researchers. Finally we relate these ideas and clarified definitions of “generalist” and “specialist” flowers to the pollination syndrome concept.},

  Abstract                 = {Many network dataset are by definition two-mode networks. Yet, few network measures can directly be applied to them. Therefore, two-mode networks are often projected onto one-mode networks by selecting a node set and linking two nodes if they were connected to common nodes in the two-mode network. This process has a major impact on the level of clustering in the network. If three or more nodes are connected to a common node in the two-mode network, the nodes form a fully-connected clique consisting of one or more triangles in the one-mode projection. A number of modeling issues is associated with this procedure. For example, a one-mode projection of a random two-mode network will have a higher clustering coefficient than its randomly expected value. This paper represents an attempt to overcome these issues by redefining both the global and local clustering coefficients so that they can be calculated directly on the two-mode structure. I illustrate the benefits of such an approach by applying it to two-mode networks from four different domains: event attendance, scientific collaboration, interlocking directorates, and online forums.},

  Abstractnote             = {Abstract We analysed the dynamics of a plant-pollinator interaction network of a scrub community surveyed over four consecutive years. Species composition within the annual networks showed high temporal variation. Temporal dynamics were also evident in the topology of the network, as interactions among plants and pollinators did not remain constant through time. This change involved both the number and the identity of interacting partners. Strikingly, few species and interactions were consistently present in all four annual plant-pollinator networks (53% of the plant species, 21% of the pollinator species and 4.9% of the interactions). The high turnover in species-to-species interactions was mainly the effect of species turnover (c. 70% in pairwise comparisons among years), and less the effect of species flexibility to interact with new partners (c. 30%). We conclude that specialization in plant-pollinator interactions might be highly overestimated when measured over short periods of time. This is because many plant or pollinator species appear as specialists in 1 year, but tend to be generalists or to interact with different partner species when observed in other years. The high temporal plasticity in species composition and interaction identity coupled with the low variation in network structure properties (e.g. degree centralization, connectance, nestedness, average distance and network diameter) imply (i) that tight and specialized coevolution might not be as important as previously suggested and (ii) that plant-pollinator interaction networks might be less prone to detrimental effects of disturbance than previously thought. We suggest that this may be due to the opportunistic nature of plant and animal species regarding the available partner resources they depend upon at any particular time.},

Integrating the various experimental and analytical methods that attempt this goal across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as well as careful definition of ‘complementarity’, produces novel insights and valuable lessons about new directions for research. (1) Experimental designs differ in temporal scale and whether standing stock or another ecosystem process was the response variable. (2) Mathematically identical variables in different designs have contrasting ecological interpretations. For example, different sets of ecological processes can contribute to different variables in different experimental designs. (3) The frequency of transgressive overyielding of standing stock (e.g. total above ground biomass) in polycultures implies little about the prevalence of transgressive overyielding in other ecosystem processes. (4) Measuring the contribution to ecosystem functioning of individual species, rather than just total ecosystem functioning of a polyculture, is not essential for estimating effects of complementarity. (5) Further research will profit from distinguishing standing stock from all other ecosystem functions. (6) None of the analytic methods can distinguish the effects of individual processes or mechanisms such as resource use differentiation, facilitation, or allelopathy, for which additional experimental treatments are required.},

DENs have a dual spatial representation; as points within the network and as points in geographical space. Consequently, some analytical methods used to quantify relationships in other types of ecological networks, or in 2-D space, may be inadequate for studying the influence of structure and connectivity on ecological processes within DENs. We propose a conceptual taxonomy of network analysis methods that account for DEN characteristics to varying degrees and provide a synthesis of the different approaches within the context of stream ecology. Within this context, we summarise the key innovations of a new family of spatial statistical models that describe spatial relationships in DENs. Finally, we discuss how different network analyses may be combined to address more complex and novel research questions. While our main focus is streams, the taxonomy of network analyses is also relevant anywhere spatial patterns in both network and 2-D space can be used to explore the influence of multi-scale processes on biota and their habitat (e.g. plant morphology and pest infestation, or preferential migration along stream or road corridors).},

  Abstractnote             = {Understanding species’ interactions and the robustness of interaction networks to species loss is essential to understand the effects of species' declines and extinctions. In most studies, different types of networks (such as food webs, parasitoid webs, seed dispersal networks, and pollination networks) have been studied separately. We sampled such multiple networks simultaneously in an agroecosystem. We show that the networks varied in their robustness; networks including pollinators appeared to be particularly fragile. We show that, overall, networks did not strongly covary in their robustness, which suggests that ecological restoration (for example, through agri-environment schemes) benefitting one functional group will not inevitably benefit others. Some individual plant species were disproportionately well linked to many other species. This type of information can be used in restoration management, because it identifies the plant taxa that can potentially lead to disproportionate gains in biodiversity.},

  Abstractnote             = {Ecological specialisation concerns all species and underlies many major ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet its status as a unifying concept is not always appreciated because of its similarity to concepts of the niche, the many levels of biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and environmental performance. This covariation itself depends upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and life history and complexity in the environment stemming from factors such as species interactions and spatio-temporal heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop a view on specialisation that integrates across the range of biological phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.},

  Abstractnote             = {In a context of global changes, and amidst the perpetual modification of community structure undergone by most natural ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how species interactions vary through space and time. The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Although pairwise interactions have always had a key role in ecology and evolutionary biology, the recent increase in the amount and availability of biological data has placed a new focus on the complex networks embedded in biological systems. The increased availability of computational tools to store and retrieve biological data has facilitated wide access to these data, not just by biologists but also by specialists from the social sciences, computer science, physics and mathematics. This fusion of interests has led to a burst of research on the properties and consequences of network structure in biological systems. Although traditional measures of network structure and function have started us off on the right foot, an important next step is to create biologically realistic models of network formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent applications of network thinking to the evolution of networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics and stability of communities. These studies have provided new insights into the organization and function of biological systems by applying existing techniques of network analysis. The current challenge is to recognize the commonalities in evolutionary and ecological applications of network thinking to create a predictive science of biological networks.},

There was evidence for significant compartmentation in several real webs, all of which are reasonably well documented, aquatic and benthic. However, there was no evidence of compartments in the Ythan web. 4. Manipulative field experiments on a range of avian, fish and invertebrate predators provided no evidence for strong functional interactions in the Ythan web. 5.

We experimentally investigated how shifts in flowering onset affect pollinator visitation for 14 native perennial plant species, six of which have exhibited shifts to earlier flowering over the last 70 years and eight of which have not. We manipulated flowering onset in greenhouses and then observed pollinator visitation in the field. Five of six species with historically advanced flowering received more visits when flowering was experimentally advanced, whereas seven of eight species with historically unchanged flowering received fewer visits when flowering earlier. This pattern suggests that species unconstrained by pollinators have advanced their flowering, whereas species constrained by pollinators have not. In contrast to current concern about phenological mismatches disrupting plant-pollinator mutualisms, mismatches at the onset of flowering are not occurring for most of our study species.},

We reconstructed the times of divergence, diversification patterns, and interaction networks of a diverse group of specialized orchids and their bee pollinators. In contrast to a scenario of coevolution by race formation, we show that fragrance-producing orchids originated at least three times independently after their fragrance-collecting bee mutualists. Whereas orchid diversification has apparently tracked the diversification of orchids' bee pollinators, bees appear to have depended on the diverse chemical environment of neotropical forests. We corroborated this apparent asymmetrical dependency by simulating co-extinction cascades in real interaction networks that lacked reciprocal specialization. These results suggest that the diversification of insect-pollinated angiosperms may have been facilitated by the exploitation of preexisting sensory biases of insect pollinators.},

Degree distribution, nestedness, and expected species persistence were evaluated. In addition, we assessed the roles of predefined subsets of plants (classified by life forms) and pollinators (grouped by taxonomic orders) in the network's structure and dynamics. For this, we simulated the complete removal of each plant and pollinator subset and analyzed the resultant connectivity patterns, as well as the expected long-term species losses by running a stochastic model. Finally, we evaluated the sensitivity of the network structure to the loss of single species in order to identify potential targets for conservation. Our results show that the plant-pollinator network of this Chilean temperate rain forest exhibits a nested structure of interactions, with a degree distribution best described by a power law model. Model simulations revealed the importance of trees and hymenopterans as pivotal groups that maintain the core structure of the pollination network and guarantee overall species persistence. The hymenopterans Bombus dahlbomii and Diphaglossa gayi, the shrubs Tepualia stipularis and Ugni molinae, the vines Mitraria coccinea and Asteranthera ovata, and the entire set of tree species exerted a disproportionately large influence on the preservation of network structure and should be considered as focal species for conservation programs given current threats from selective logging and habitat loss.},

Two classes of dynamics can be distinguished in ecological networks; population dynamics, represented mainly by changes in species abundances, and topological dynamics, represented by changes in the architecture of the web. 2. In this study, we model the temporal evolution of three empirical plant-pollination networks incorporating both population and topological dynamics. We test the hypothesis that topological plasticity, realized through the ability of animals to rewire their connections after depletion of host abundances, enhances tolerance of mutualistic networks to species loss. We also compared the performance of various rewiring rules in affecting robustness. 3. The results show that topological plasticity markedly increased the robustness of mutualistic networks. Our analyses also revealed that network robustness reached maximum levels when animals with less host plant availability were more likely to rewire. Also, preferential attachment to richer host plants, that is, to plants exhibiting higher abundance and few exploiters, enhances robustness more than other rewiring alternatives. 4. Our results highlight the potential role of topological plasticity in the robustness of mutualistic networks to species extinctions and suggest some plausible mechanisms by which the decisions of foragers may shape the collective dynamics of plant-pollinator systems.},

We resolved an arctic, entire-season plant-flower visitor network into a temporal series of 1-day networks and compared the properties with its static equivalent based on data pooled over the entire season. Several properties differed. The nested link pattern in the static network was blurred in the dynamical version, because the characteristic long nestedness tail of flower–visitor specialists got stunted in the dynamical networks. This tail comprised a small food web of pollinators, parasitoids and hyper-parasitoids. The dynamical network had strong time delays in the transmission of direct and indirect effects among species. Twenty percent of all indirect links were impossible in the dynamical network. Consequently, properties and thus also robustness of ecological networks cannot be deduced from the static topology alone.},

Finding evidence for this community organization is important since compartmentalization may strongly affect food web robustness to perturbation. However, few studies have found unequivocal evidence of compartments, and none has quantified the suite of mechanisms generating such a structure. Here, we combine computational tools from the physics of complex networks with phylogenetic statistical methods to show that a large marine food web is organized in compartments, and that body size, phylogeny, and spatial structure are jointly associated with such a compartmentalized structure. Sharks account for the majority of predatory interactions within their compartments. Phylogenetically closely related shark species tend to occupy different compartments and have divergent trophic levels, suggesting that competition may play an important role structuring some of these compartments. Current overfishing of sharks has the potential to change the structural properties, which might eventually affect the stability of the food web.},

  abstract      = {Mass-flowering crops may affect long-term population dynamics, but effects on pollinators have never been studied across several years. We monitored wild bees in oilseed rape fields in 16 landscapes in Germany in two consecutive years. Effects on bee densities of landscape oilseed rape cover in the years of monitoring and in the previous years were evaluated with landscape data from three consecutive years. We fit empirical data to a mechanistic model to provide estimates for oilseed rape attractiveness and its effect on bee productivity in comparison to the rest of the landscape, and we evaluated consequences for pollinator densities in consecutive years. Our results show that high oilseed rape cover in the previous year enhances current densities of wild bees (except for bumble bees). Moreover, we show a strong attractiveness of and dilution on (i.e., decreasing bee densities with increasing landscape oilseed rape cover) oilseed rape for bees during flowering in the current year, modifying the effect of the previous year's oilseed rape cover in the case of wild bees (excluding Bombus). As long as other factors such as nesting sites or natural enemies do not limit bee reproduction, our findings suggest long-term positive effects of mass-flowering crops on bee populations, at least for non-Bombus generalists, which possibly help to maintain crop pollination services even when crop area increases. Similar effects are conceivable for other organisms providing ecosystem services in annual crops and should be considered in future studies.},

  abstract =      {Plant-animal interaction networks provide important information on community organization. One of the most critical assumptions of network analysis is that the observed interaction patterns constitute an adequate sample of the set of interactions present in plant-animal communities. In spite of its importance, few studies have evaluated this assumption, and in consequence, there is no consensus on the sensitivity of network metrics to sampling methodological shortcomings. In this study we examined how variation in sampling completeness influences the estimation of six network metrics frequently used in the literature (connectance, nestedness, modularity, robustness to species loss, path length, and centralization). We analyzed data of 186 flowering plants and 336 pollinator species in 10 networks from a forest-fragmented system in central Chile. Using species-based accumulation curves, we estimated the deviation of network metrics in undersampled communities with respect to exhaustively sampled communities and the effect of network size and sampling evenness on network metrics. Our results indicate that: (1) most metrics were affected by sampling completeness but differed in their sensitivity to sampling effort; (2) nestedness, modularity, and robustness to species loss were less influenced by insufficient sampling than connectance, path length, and centralization; (3) robustness was mildly influenced by sampling evenness. These results caution studies that summarize information from databases with high, or unknown, heterogeneity in sampling effort per species and should stimulate researchers to report sampling intensity to standardize its effects in the search for broad patterns in plant-pollinator networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Several stochastic models have tried to capture the architecture of food webs. This approach is interesting, but it is limited by the fact that different assumptions can yield similar results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a purely statistical approach. Body size in terms of an optimal ratio between prey and predator is used as explanatory variable. In 12 observed food webs, this model predicts, on average, 20{\%} of interactions. To analyze the unexplained part, we introduce a latent term: each species is described by two latent traits, foraging and vulnerability, that represent nonmeasured characteristics of species once the optimal body size has been accounted for. The model now correctly predicts an average of 73{\%} of links. The key features of our approach are that latent traits quantify the structure that is left unexplained by the explanatory variable and that this quantification allows a test of whether independent biological information, such as microhabitat use, camouflage, or phylogeny, explains this structure. We illustrate this method with phylogeny and find that it is linked to one or both latent traits in nine of 12 food webs. Our approach opens the door to the formulation of more complex models that can be applied to any kind of biological network.},

Although biodiversity has been associated with stability, the actual structures and processes that confer stability to diverse food webs remain largely unknown. Here we show that real food webs are structured such that top predators act as couplers of distinct energy channels that differ in both productivity and turnover rate. Our theoretical analysis shows that coupled fast and slow channels convey both local and non-local stability to food webs. Alarmingly, the same human actions that have been implicated in the loss of biodiversity also directly erode the very structures and processes that we show to confer stability on food webs.},

We present the first systematic review of pollination syndromes that quantitatively tests whether the most effective pollinators for a species can be inferred from suites of floral traits for 417 plant species. Our results support the syndrome concept, indicating that convergent floral evolution is driven by adaptation to the most effective pollinator group. The predictability of pollination syndromes is greater in pollinator-dependent species and in plants from tropical regions. Many plant species also have secondary pollinators that generally correspond to the ancestral pollinators documented in evolutionary studies. We discuss the utility and limitations of pollination syndromes and the role of secondary pollinators to understand floral ecology and evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {A central question in community ecology is how the number of trophic links relates to community species richness. For simple dynamical food-web models, link density (the ratio of links to species) is bounded from above as the number of species increases; but empirical data suggest that it increases without bounds. We found a new empirical upper bound on link density in large marine communities with emphasis on fish and squid, using novel methods that avoid known sources of bias in traditional approaches. Bounds are expressed in terms of the diet-partitioning function (DPF): the average number of resources contributing more than a fraction f to a consumer's diet, as a function of f. All observed DPF follow a functional form closely related to a power law, with power-law exponents independent of species richness at the measurement accuracy. Results imply universal upper bounds on link density across the oceans. However, the inherently scale-free nature of power-law diet partitioning suggests that the DPF itself is a better defined characterization of network structure than link density.},

This article introduces a method for estimating the link density from diet tables which do not cover the complete food web and do not resolve all diet items to species level. A simple formula for the error of this estimate is derived. Link density is determined as a function of a threshold diet fraction below which diet items are ignored ("diet partitioning function"). Furthermore, analytic relationships between this threshold-dependent link density and the generality distribution of food webs are established. A preliminary application of the method to field data suggests that empirical results relating link density to diversity might need to be revisited.},

We examine whether arranging the interactions of a competitive system into compartments influences the system properties of linear stability, feasibility, reactivity, and biomass stability, thereby altering the likelihood of species persistence. Model Lotka-Volterra systems of diffuse competition were analysed with interactions arranged randomly and in compartments. It was found, using a variety of dynamical measures, that arranging interactions into compartments enhances the likelihood of species persistence. Since many natural competitive systems appear to have interactions arranged within compartments, this may be an outcome of the positive attributes that this form of organization offers.},

  abstract =  {Networks are a popular way to visually represent and analyse interactions between species in ecological communities, and there have been several recent calls for interaction network measures to be targets of conservation and management efforts. However, it is challenging to deliberately manipulate empirical network properties. Our objective was to determine whether the network property of connectance could be manipulated in a planned and deliberate fashion, without altering the size of the community. Connectance (proportion of realized interactions out of total number of possible interactions) is often used as a proxy for community complexity, and theory also suggests it is related to community robustness and stability. We designed a field experiment to increase the connectance of a mutualistic community by manipulating the attractiveness of plant species in a bee-plant interaction network. Specifically, we applied a chemical fertilizer to enhance the floral display and resource quality provided by experimental plants, and assessed the effect on bee community structure. We found the connectance was significantly higher in fertilized plots relative to controls. This manipulation was associated with a significant increase in both the species richness (+41%) and abundance (+77%) of pollinators; there were more pollinator species in treatment plots, and these pollinators visited more plant species with a higher frequency. This study shows that a network property can indeed be altered experimentally; here we were able to deliberately increase the connectance of a bee-plant network while keeping constant both the number of plant species and the background community of potential floral visitors. Deliberate manipulation of experimental community structure therefore could be a valuable avenue for future research. Integration of network theory with empirical research also has the potential to inform the design of network control approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we develop a method, termed the Interaction Distribution (ID) method, for analysis of quantitative ecological network data. In many cases, quantitative network data sets are under-sampled, i.e. many interactions are poorly sampled or remain unobserved. Hence, the output of statistical analyses may fail to differentiate between patterns that are statistical artefacts and those which are real characteristics of ecological networks. The ID method can support assessment and inference of under-sampled ecological network data. In the current paper, we illustrate and discuss the ID method based on the properties of plant-animal pollination data sets of flower visitation frequencies. However, the ID method may be applied to other types of ecological networks. The method can supplement existing network analyses based on two definitions of the underlying probabilities for each combination of pollinator and plant species: (1), take place on the ‚Äôth plant species; (2), the : the probability for a visit made by the th pollinator species to ‚Äôth pollinator. The method applies the Dirichlet distribution to estimate these two probabilities, based on a given empirical data set. The estimated mean values for numbers of visits for different pollinator and plant species, and the estimated uncertainty of reflect the relative differences between recorded and decreases with higher numbers of recorded visits.},

  Abstract                 = {In theoretical ecology, simple stochastic models that satisfy two basic conditions about the distribution of niche values and feeding ranges have proved successful in reproducing the overall structural properties of real food webs, using species richness and connectance as the only input parameters. Recently, more detailed models have incorporated higher levels of constraint in order to reproduce the actual links observed in real food webs. Here, building on previous stochastic models of consumer-resource interactions between species, we propose a highly parsimonious model that can reproduce the overall bipartite structure of cooperative partner-partner interactions, as exemplified by plant-animal mutualistic networks. Our stochastic model of bipartite cooperation uses simple specialization and interaction rules, and only requires three empirical input parameters. We test the bipartite cooperation model on ten large pollination data sets that have been compiled in the literature, and find that it successfully replicates the degree distribution, nestedness and modularity of the empirical networks. These properties are regarded as key to understanding cooperation in mutualistic networks. We also apply our model to an extensive data set of two classes of company engaged in joint production in the garment industry. Using the same metrics, we find that the network of manufacturer-contractor interactions exhibits similar structural patterns to plant-animal pollination networks. This surprising correspondence between ecological and organizational networks suggests that the simple rules of cooperation that generate bipartite networks may be generic, and could prove relevant in many different domains, ranging from biological systems to human society.},

We explored the consequences that simple linkage rules based on the first two hypotheses (complementarity of traits versus barriers to exploitation) had on the topology of plant–pollination networks. Independent of the linkage rules used, the inclusion of a small set of traits (two to four) sufficed to account for the complex topological patterns observed in real-world networks. Optimal performance was achieved by a ‘‘mixed model’’ that combined rules that link plants and pollinators whose trait ranges overlap (‘‘complementarity models’’) and rules that link pollinators to flowers whose traits are below a pollinator-specific barrier value (‘‘barrier models’’). Deterrence of floral parasites (barrier model) is therefore at least as important as increasing pollination efficiency (complementarity model) in the evolutionary shaping of plant–pollinator networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Masting, the synchronized and intermittent seed production by plant populations, provides highly variable food resources for specialist seed predators. Such a reproductive mode helps minimize seed losses through predator satiation and extinction of seed predator populations. The seed predators can buffer the resource variation through dispersal or extended diapause. We developed a spatially explicit resource-consumer model to understand the effect of masting on specialist seed predators. The masting dynamics were assumed to follow a resource-based model for plant reproduction, and the population dynamics of the predator were represented by a spatially extended Nicholson-Bailey model. The resultant model demonstrated that when host plants reproduce intermittently, seed predator populations go locally extinct, but global persistence of the predator is facilitated by dispersal or extended diapause. Global extinction of the predator resulted when the intermittent reproduction is highly synchronized among plants. An approximate invasion criterion for the predators showed that negative lag-1 autocorrelation in seeding reduces invasibility, and positive lag-1 cross-correlation enhances invasibility. Spatial synchronization in seeding at local scale caused by pollen coupling (or climate forcing) further prevented invasion of the predators. If the predators employed extended diapause, extremely high temporal variability in reproduction was required for plants to evade the predators.},

Pollination of flowers with long corolla tubes by long-tongued hawkmoths has been invoked as a showcase model of coevolution. Recently, optimal foraging models have predicted that there might be a close association between mouthparts length and the corolla depth of the visited flowers, thus favouring trait convergence and specialisation at community level. 2.Here, we assessed whether hawkmoths more frequently pollinate plants with floral tube lengths similar to their proboscis lengths (morphological match hypothesis) against abundance-based processes (neutral hypothesis) and ecological trait mismatches constraints (forbidden links hypothesis), in structuring hawkmoth-plant mutualistic networks from five communities in four biogeographical regions of South America. 3.We found convergence in morphological traits across the five communities and that the distribution of morphological differences between hawkmoths and plants is consistent with expectations under the morphological match hypothesis in three of the five communities. In the two remaining communities, which are ecotones between two distinct biogeographic areas, interactions are better predicted by the neutral hypothesis. 4.Our findings are consistent with the idea that diffuse coevolution drives the evolution of extremely long proboscises and flower tubes, and highlight the importance of morphological traits, beyond the forbidden links hypothesis, in structuring interactions between mutualistic partners, revealing that the role of niche-based processes can be much more complex than previously known.

Although predicting such critical points before they are reached is extremely difficult, work in different scientific fields is now suggesting the existence of generic early-warning signals that may indicate for a wide class of systems if a critical threshold is approaching.},

  Abstract                 = {Species-rich tropical communities are expected to be more specialized than their temperate counterparts [1‚Äì3]. Several studies have reported increasing biotic specialization toward the tropics [4‚Äì7], whereas others have not found latitudinal trends once accounting for sampling bias [8, 9] or differences in plant diversity [10, 11]. Thus, the direction of the latitudinal specialization gradient remains contentious. With an unprecedented global data set, we investigated how biotic specialization between plants and animal pollinators or seed dispersers is associated with latitude, past and contemporary climate, and plant diversity. We show that in contrast to expectation, biotic specialization of mutualistic networks is significantly lower at tropical than at temperate latitudes. Specialization was more closely related to contemporary climate than to past climate stability, suggesting that current conditions have a stronger effect on biotic specialization than historical community stability. Biotic specialization decreased with increasing local and regional plant diversity. This suggests that high specialization of mutualistic interactions is a response of pollinators and seed dispersers to low plant diversity. This could explain why the latitudinal specialization gradient is reversed relative to the latitudinal diversity gradient. Low mutualistic network specialization in the tropics suggests higher tolerance against extinctions in tropical than in temperate communities.},

One of the principal arguments against this observation is that it is valid only for random networks, and therefore does not apply to real-world networks, which presumably are structured. Here, we examine how the introduction of small-world topological structure into networks affects their stability. Our results indicate that, in structured networks, the parameter values at which the stability-instability transition occurs with increasing complexity is identical to that predicted by the May-Wigner criteria. However, the nature of the transition, as measured by the finite-size scaling exponent, appears to change as the network topology transforms from regular to random, with the small-world regime as the cross-over region. This behavior is related to the localization of the largest eigenvalues along the real axis in the eigenvalue plain with increasing regularity in the network. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Species richness and taxonomic composition of pollinator assemblages are documented for 26 plant species from temperate rain forests of northern Chiloe Island, southern Chile (42 degrees 30'S). We investigated the patterns of generalism and specialization among plants and animal pollinators by comparing the flower visit frequency by different pollen vectors during the spring and summer months of three consecutive years (2000-2002). Species studied exhibited a range of floral morphologies (radial vs. zygomorphic, open vs. tubular) and rewards (nectar and/or pollen). Overall, we recorded 172 pollinator species, with an average of 6.6 species of pollen vectors/plant species. Pollinators visited an average of 15.2 plant species/pollen vector. Pollinator assemblages were dominated by Coleoptera (75 species), Diptera (56 species) and Hymenoptera (30 species), but passerine birds and hummingbirds were also important. The most specialized plants were vines, including the bee-pollinated genus Luzuriaga (Philesiaceae) and two endemic species of hummingbird-pollinated Gesneriaceae. Hymenoptera contributed 41.2{\%} of all visits, with the bumblebee Bombus dalhbomi accounting for 22.5{\%} of these. Plants with unspecialized flower morphology supported a higher species richness of pollinators, but visiting rates did not differ from specialized flowers. 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.},

  Abstract                 = {The number of interactions with flower visitor species differs considerably among insect pollinated plants. Knowing the causes for this variation is central to the conservation of single species as well as whole plant-flower visitor communities. Species specific constraints on flower visitor numbers are seldom investigated at the community level. In this study we tested whether flower size parameters set constraints on the morphology of the potential nectar feeding visitors and thus determine the number of visitor species. We studied three possible constraints: the depth and width of tubular structures hiding the nectar (nectar holder depth and width) and the size of flower parts that visitors can land on (size of the alighting place). In addition we assess the role of flower abundance on this relationship. We hypothesized that the stronger size constraints and the smaller flower abundance, the smaller the number of visitor species will be. Our study of a Mediterranean plant-flower visitor community revealed that nectar holder depth, nectar holder width and number of flowers explained 71{\%} of the variation in the number of visitor species. The size of the alighting place did not restrict the body length of the visitors and was not related to visitor species number. In a second step of the analyses we calculated for each plant species the potential number of visitors by determining for each insect species of the local visitor pool whether it passed the morphological limits set by the plant. These potential numbers were highly correlated with the observed numbers (r(2)=0.5, p < 0.001). For each plant species we tested whether the observed visitors were a random selection out of these potential visitors by comparing the mean of the observed and expected proboscis length distributions. For most plant species the observed mean was not significantly different from the random means. Our findings shed light on the way plant-flower visitor networks are structured. Knowing the constraints on interaction patterns will be an important prerequisite to formulate realistic null models and understand patterns of resource partitioning as well as coevolutionary processes.},

  Abstract                 = {A recently discovered feature of plant-flower visitor webs is the asymmetric specialization of the interaction partners: specialized plants interact mainly with generalized flower visitors and specialized flower visitors mainly with generalized plants. Little is known about the factors leading to this asymmetry and their consequences for the extinction risk of species. Previous studies have proposed random interactions proportional to species abundance as an explanation. However, the simulation models used in these studies did not include potential biological constraints. In the present study, we tested the potential role of both morphological constraints and species abundance in promoting asymmetric specialization. We compared actual field data of a Mediterranean plant-flower visitor web with predictions of Monte Carlo simulations including different combinations of the potential factors structuring the web. Our simulations showed that both nectar-holder depth and abundance were able to produce asymmetry; but that the expected degree of asymmetry was stronger if based on both. Both factors can predict the number of interaction partners, but only nectar-holder depth was able to predict the degree of asymmetry of a certain species. What is more, without the size threshold the influence of abundance would disappear over time. Thus, asymmetric specialization seems to be the result of a size threshold and, only among the allowed interactions above this size threshold, a result of random interactions proportional to abundance. The simulations also showed that asymmetric specialization could not be the reason that the extinction risk of specialists and generalists is equalized, as suggested in the literature. In asymmetric webs specialists clearly had higher short-term extinction risks. In fact, primarily generalist visitors seem to profit from asymmetric specialization. In our web, specialists were less abundant than generalists. Therefore, including abundance in the simulation models increased the difference between specialists and generalists even more.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many recent studies show that plant-pollinator interaction webs exhibit consistent structural features such as long-tailed distributions of the degree of generalization, nestedness of interactions and asymmetric interaction dependencies. Recognition of these shared features has led to a variety of mechanistic attempts at explanation. Here it is hypothesized that beside size thresholds and species abundances, the frequency distribution of sizes (nectar depths and proboscis lengths) will play a key role in determining observed interaction patterns. METHODS: To test the influence of size distributions, a new network parameter is introduced: the degree of size matching between nectar depth and proboscis length. The observed degree of size matching in a Spanish plant-pollinator web was compared with the expected degree based on joint probability distributions, integrating size thresholds and abundance, and taking the sampling method into account. KEY RESULTS: Nectar depths and proboscis lengths both exhibited right-skewed frequency distributions across species and individuals. Species-based size matching was equally close for plants, independent of nectar depth, but differed significantly for pollinators of dissimilar proboscis length. The observed patterns were predicted well by a model considering size distributions across species. Observed size matching was closer when relative abundances of species were included, especially for flowers with openly accessible nectar and pollinators with long proboscises, but was predicted somewhat less successfully by the model that included abundances. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that in addition to size thresholds and species abundances, size distributions are important for understanding interaction patterns in plant-pollinator webs. It is likely that the understanding will be improved further by characterizing for entire communities how nectar production of flowers and energetic requirements of pollinators covary with size, and how sampling methods influence the observed interaction patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecologists are fascinated by the prevalence of nestedness in biogeographic and community data, where it is thought to promote biodiversity in mutualistic systems. Traditionally, nestedness has been treated in a binary sense: species and their interactions are either present or absent, neglecting information on abundances and interaction frequencies. Extending nestedness to quantitative data facilitates the study of species preferences, and we propose a new detection method that follows from a basic property of bipartite networks: large dominant eigenvalues are associated with highly nested configurations. We show that complex ecological networks are binary nested, but quantitative preferences are non-nested, indicating limited consumer overlap of favoured resources. The spectral graph approach provides a formal link to local dynamical stability analysis, where we demonstrate that nested mutualistic structures are minimally stable. We conclude that, within the binary constraint of interaction plausibility, species preferences are partitioned to avoid competition, thereby benefiting system-wide resource allocation.},

We studied the effect of host abundance on parasite abundance and prevalence using data on 57 associations of fleas (Siphonaptera) and their mammalian hosts from Slovakia. 2. We assumed that flea-induced host mortality could be inferred from the relationship between flea aggregation and flea abundance, whereas host-induced flea mortality could be inferred from the relationship between flea abundance or aggregation and host abundance. 3. Relationships between flea abundance or prevalence and host abundance were either negative (in 23 flea-host associations) or absent (in 34 flea-host associations). Negative relationships between flea abundance and host abundance were always accompanied by negative relationships between flea prevalence and host abundance. 4. The link between flea abundance/prevalence and host abundance was evaluated as the coefficient of determination of the respective regressions. Across flea-host associations, this link decreased with an increase in the degree of flea aggregation (measured as a parameter b of Taylor's power law). 5. Mean crowding of fleas decreased with an increase of host abundance in eight flea-host associations, being asymptotic in four of them. On the other hand, mean crowding of fleas increased with an increase in flea abundance in 49 flea-host associations, being asymptotic in 15 of them. 6. Results of this study suggest that different flea-host associations are governed by different regulating mechanisms, but different regulation mechanisms may act simultaneously within the same flea-host associations.},

  Abstractnote             = {There is a long-standing dispute over whether the analysis of species co-occurrence data, typically on islands in an archipelago, can disclose the forces at work in structuring a community. Here we present and utilise three “scores” S, C and T. S gives the mean number of islands shared by a species pair in the presence/absence data under study. The scores C and T are based on the way that a pair of species occurs on a pair of islands. When each species occurs on a different island, this adds to the “checkerboard score” C; if they occupy the same island, this increases the “togetherness score” T. In judging whether observed values of S, C and T are compatible with a null hypothesis assuming no species interaction, we follow Connor and Simberloff (1979) in generating a “control group” of (constrained) simulated incidence patterns. Presence/absence matrices can have paradoxical features, in combining a high mutual exclusion by species (checkerboardedness) with a degree of species aggregation that is also high. We show that this is in fact inevitable - that, given the usual contraints, C and T can differ only by a constant. This means that extreme checkerboardedness can be produced by forces making for species aggregation, just as well as by those making for avoidance. If we restrict our attention to a subset of species, the constraints are less rigid and the S, C and T scores are somewhat freer to vary. We consider the confamilial subsets in the Vanuatu archipelago as likely candidates for revealing any competition forces at work. Calculating the actual S, C and T scores for these subsets, we compare them with the corresponding scores in a sample of simulated colonization patterns. The actual species-distributions differ significantly from what we would expect if the colonization choices of different species were uncorrelated (save for some biological constraints). The confamilial species of the real world share more islands, and occur in a pattern less checkerboarded, and more aggregated, than their simulation counterparts. This suggests that competition pressures, if they exist, are overcome by countervailing factors. The method used is applicable in other ways, and to a wider class of problems, in analysing the forces behind community structure.},

Classically, the niche was described as an n-dimensional hypervolume where each dimension represents a biotic or abiotic characteristic. More recently, it has been hypothesised that a single dimension may be sufficient to explain the system-level organization of trophic interactions observed between species in a community. 2. Here, we test the hypothesis that species body mass is that single dimension. Specifically, we determine how the intervality of food webs ordered by body size compares to that of randomly ordered food webs. We also extend this analysis beyond the community level to the effect of body mass in explaining the diets of individual species. 3. We conclude that body mass significantly explains the ordering of species and the contiguity of diets in empirical communities. 4. At the species-specific level, we find that the degree to which body mass is a significant explanatory variable depends strongly on the phylogenetic history, suggesting that other evolutionarily conserved traits partly account for species’ roles in the food web. 5. Our investigation of the role of body mass in food webs thus helps us to better understand the important features of community food-web structure and the evolutionary forces that have led us to the communities we observe.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim Interactingcommunitiesofspeciesareorganizedintocomplexnetworks,and network analysis is reckoned to be a strong tool for describing their architecture. Many species assemblies show strong macroecological patterns, e.g. increasing species richness with decreasing latitude, but whether this latitudinal diversity gradient scales up to entities as complex as networks is unknown. We investigated this using a dataset of 54 community-wide pollination networks and hypothesized that pollination networks would display a latitudinal and altitudinal species rich- ness gradient, increasing specialization towards the tropics, and that network topol- ogy would be affected by current climate. Location Global. Methods Eachnetworkwasorganizedasapresence/absencematrix,consistingof P plant species, A pollinator species and their links. From these matrices, network parameters were estimated. Additionally, data about geography (latitude, eleva- tion), climate at the network site (temperature, precipitation) and sampling effort (observation days) and extent (study-plot size) were gathered. Analyses were done using simultaneous autoregressive modelling (SAR). Results Species richness did not vary strongly with either latitude or elevation. However, network modularity decreased significantly with latitude whereas mean number of links per plant species (Lp) and A/P ratio peaked at mid-latitude. Above 500 m a.s.l., A/P ratio decreased and mean number of links per pollinator species (La) increased with elevation. Lp displayed mid-ambient peaks with temperature and nestedness and modularity displayed linear relationships with precipitation. Main conclusion Pollination networks showed macroecological patterns. No strong latitudinal or altitudinal gradient in species richness was observed. Lp and the A/P ratio peaked at mid-latitude whereas modularity decreased linearly. Both patterns are suggestive of a more specialized interaction structure towards the tropics. In particular, mean annual precipitation appeared influential on network topology as both nestedness and modularity varied significantly. Importantly, cor- rected regressions suggest that neither sampling effort nor extent affected the observed patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {1, Results from four field studies show that communities of trap-nesting bees and wasps and their natural enemies are promising bioindicators for ecological change or habitat quality. These small and easy-to-handle communities can be analysed with respect to (i) species richness and related parameters, and (ii) ecological functions or interactions. The communities comprise Hymenoptera (Apidae, Sphecidae, Eumenidae, Pompilidae) and natural enemies belonging to many insect taxa. Traps consisted of 150-200, 15-20-cm long, reed internodes, put into tills or plastic tubes of 13-15 cm diameter; wooden posts with 2-10 of such reed-filled tins were exposed ill the target habitat. 2, Species richness and abundance of bees (but trot wasps) were closely related to plant species richness of the habitat, a measure of the bees' food resource. However, availability of nest sites of above-ground nesting species was equally important: meadows with old trees supported greater populations than meadows without trees. A threefold increase in exposed traps resulted in a twofold increase in species. 3. The sensitivity of this bioindicator system profits from the fact that evaluations rely not only on presence/absence data, descriptive population attributes or diversity indices, but also on interactions or ecological functions. Monitoring ecological responses or multitrophic interactions, and their relationship to species diversity, is rarely done but much needed. Ecological functions include (i) the percentage mortality of trap-nesting bees and wasps due to parasitoids and predators, which was correlated with the species richness of these natural enemies; (ii) seed set of allogamous plants due to successful pollination by trap-nesting bees; and (iii) biological control by the predacious wasps. 4, With increasing isolation of fragmented habitats (when traps were exposed in a cleared agricultural landscape), both species richness of natural enemies and percentage mortality (parasitism and predation) declined significantly. In a comparison of habitat types (grasslands and field mal-gins), species richness of the trap-nest community correlated with plant diversity, but percentage mortality, due to parasitism and predation, with field age only. The threshold distance to the nearest habitat was 106-530 m for a 10 50{\%} decrease in mean mortality, and the mortality increased greatly in habitats that were older than 5 years. Accordingly, these studies emphasize the significance of a continuum of old habitat patches for the augmentation of nat ural enemies. 5, Exposure of standardized traps is an experimental approach with a small, interacting and reproducing community that can be easily characterized by simple parameters. Taxonomy and biology are well known, and quick evaluations can be done using the close correlation between the number of occupied traps and species richness. Species richness of trap-nesting bees and wasps was closely correlated with that sampled by sweep nets. Further criteria of indicator taxa that apply to this system are discussed in the text.},

  Abstract                 = {Most plant-pollinator network studies are conducted at species level, whereas little is known about network patterns at the individual level. In fact, nodes in traditional species-based interaction networks are aggregates of individuals establishing the actual links observed in nature. Thus, emergent properties of interaction networks might be the result of mechanisms acting at the individual level. Pollen loads carried by insect flower visitors from two mountain communities were studied to construct pollen-transport networks. For the first time, these community-wide pollen-transport networks were downscaled from species-species (sp-sp) to individuals-species (i-sp) in order to explore specialization, network patterns and niche variation at both interacting levels. We used a null model approach to account for network size differences inherent to the downscaling process. Specifically, our objectives were (i) to investigate whether network structure changes with downscaling, (ii) to evaluate the incidence and magnitude of individual specialization in pollen use and (iii) to identify potential ecological factors influencing the observed degree of individual specialization. Network downscaling revealed a high specialization of pollinator individuals, which was masked and unexplored in sp-sp networks. The average number of interactions per node, connectance, interaction diversity and degree of nestedness decreased in i-sp networks, because generalized pollinator species were composed of specialized and idiosyncratic conspecific individuals. An analysis with 21 pollinator species representative of two communities showed that mean individual pollen resource niche was only c. 46{\%} of the total species niche. The degree of individual specialization was associated with inter- and intraspecific overlap in pollen use, and it was higher for abundant than for rare species. Such niche heterogeneity depends on individual differences in foraging behaviour and likely has implications for community dynamics and species stability. Our findings highlight the importance of taking interindividual variation into account when studying higher-order structures such as interaction networks. We argue that exploring individual-based networks will improve our understanding of species-based networks and will enhance the link between network analysis, foraging theory and evolutionary biology.},

  Abstract                 = {Global conversion of natural habitats to agriculture has led to marked changes in species diversity and composition. However, it is less clear how habitat modification affects interactions among species. Networks of feeding interactions (food webs) describe the underlying structure of ecological communities, and might be crucially linked to their stability and function. Here, we analyse 48 quantitative food webs for cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids across five tropical habitat types. We found marked changes in food-web structure across the modification gradient, despite little variation in species richness. The evenness of interaction frequencies declined with habitat modification, with most energy flowing along one or a few pathways in intensively managed agricultural habitats. In modified habitats there was a higher ratio of parasitoid to host species and increased parasitism rates, with implications for the important ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological control, that are performed by host bees and wasps. The most abundant parasitoid species was more specialized in modified habitats, with reduced attack rates on alternative hosts. Conventional community descriptors failed to discriminate adequately among habitats, indicating that perturbation of the structure and function of ecological communities might be overlooked in studies that do not document and quantify species interactions. Altered interaction structure therefore represents an insidious and functionally important hidden effect of habitat modification by humans.},

  Abstract                 = {Two opposing patterns of meta-community organization are nestedness and negative species co-occurrence. Both patterns can be quantified with metrics that are applied to presence-absence matrices and tested with null model analysis. Previous meta-analyses have given conflicting results, with the same set of matrices apparently showing high nestedness (Wright et al. 1998) and negative species co-occurrence (Gotelli and McCabe 2002). We clarified the relationship between nestedness and co-occurrence by creating random matrices, altering them systematically to increase or decrease the degree of nestedness or co-occurrence, and then testing the resulting patterns with null models. Species co-occurrence is related to the degree of nestedness, but the sign of the relationship depends on how the test matrices were created. Low-fill matrices created by simple, uniform sampling generate negative correlations between nestedness and co-occurrence: negative species co-occurrence is associated with disordered matrices. However, high-fill matrices created by passive sampling generate the opposite pattern: negative species co-occurrence is associated with highly nested matrices. The patterns depend on which index of species co-occurrence is used, and they are not symmetric: systematic changes in the co-occurrence structure of a matrix are only weakly associated with changes in the pattern of nestedness. In all analyses, the fixed-fixed null model that preserves matrix row and column totals has lower type I and type II error probabilities than an equiprobable null model that relaxes row and column totals. The latter model is part of the popular nestedness temperature calculator, which detects nestedness too frequently in random matrices (type I statistical error). When compared to a valid null model, a matrix with negative species co-occurrence may be either highly nested or disordered, depending on the biological processes that determine row totals (number of species occurrences) and column totals (number of species per site).},

  Abstract                 = {Nestedness is a common biogeographic pattern in which small communities form proper subsets of large communities. However, the detection of nestedness in binary presence‚Äìabsence matrices will be affected by both the metric used to quantify nestedness and the reference null distribution. In this study, we assessed the statistical performance of eight estedness metrics and six null model algorithms. The metrics and algorithms were tested against a benchmark set of 200 random matrices and 200 nested matrices that were created by passive sampling. Many algorithms that have been used in nestedness studies are vulnerable to type I errors (falsely rejecting a true null hypothesis). The best-performing algorithm maintains fixed row and fixed column totals, but it is conservative and may not always detect nestedness when it is present. Among the eight indices, the popular matrix temperature metric did not have good statistical properties. Instead, the Brualdi and Sanderson discrepancy index and Cutler‚Äôs index of unexpected presences performed best. When used with the fixed-fixed algorithm, these indices provide a conservative test for nestedness. Although previous studies have revealed a high frequency of nestedness, a reanalysis of 288 empirical matrices suggests that the true frequency of nested matrices is between 10{\%} and 40{\%}.},

Because interaction frequency is easier to estimate than per-interaction effect, using interaction frequency as a surrogate of total effect could facilitate the large-scale analysis of quantitative patterns of species-rich interaction networks. We show mathematically that the correlation between interaction frequency (I) and total effect (T) becomes more strongly positive the greater the variation of I relative to the variation of per-interaction effect (P) and the greater the correlation between I and P. A meta-analysis using data on I, P and T for animal pollinators and seed dispersers visiting plants shows a generally strong, positive relationship between T and I, in spite of no general relationship between P and I. Thus, frequent animal mutualists usually contribute the most to plant reproduction, regardless of their effectiveness on a per-interaction basis.},

Although such focus on networks has brought about important insights into the structure of these interactions, relatively little is still known about the mechanisms behind these patterns. SCOPE: The aim in this paper is to offer an overview of the mechanisms influencing the structure of plant-animal mutualistic networks. A brief summary is presented of the salient network patterns, the potential mechanisms are discussed and the studies that have evaluated them are reviewed. This review shows that researchers of plant-animal mutualisms have made substantial progress in the understanding of the processes behind the patterns observed in mutualistic networks. At the same time, we are still far from a thorough, integrative mechanistic understanding. We close with specific suggestions for directions of future research, which include developing methods to evaluate the relative importance of mechanisms influencing network patterns and focusing research efforts on selected representative study systems throughout the world.},

  Abstract                 = {Niche breadth of species has been hypothesized to be associated with species' responses to disturbance. Disturbance is usually believed to affect specialists negatively, while generalists are believed to benefit from disturbance; we call this the "specialization-disturbance" hypothesis. We also propose an associated hypothesis (the "specialization-asymmetry-disturbance" hypothesis) under which both specialization and asymmetry of interactions would explain species' responses to disturbance. We test these hypotheses using data from a plant-pollinator system that has been grazed by cattle (i.e., a biological disturbance) in southern Argentina. We quantified specialization in species interactions, specialization of interaction partners, and species' responses to disturbance. We found no relationship between degree of specialization and a species' response to disturbance. We also found that plant-pollinator interactions tend to be asymmetric in this system; there was no relationship between the degree of specialization of a given species and the degree of specialization of its interaction partners. However, asymmetry of interactions did not explain the variability in species' responses to disturbance. Thus, both hypotheses are rejected by our data. Possible reasons include failure to assess crucial resources, substantial direct effects of disturbance, inaccurate measures of specialization, difficulty detecting highly nonlinear relationships, and limitations of a nonexperimental approach. Or, in fact, there may be no relationship between specialization and response to disturbance.},

  abstractnote = {The pollination success of animal-pollinated plants depends on the temporal coupling between flowering schedules and pollinator availability. Within a population, individual plants exhibiting disparate flowering schedules will be exposed to different pollinators when the latter exhibit temporal turnover. The temporal overlap between individual plants and pollinators will result in a turnover of interactions, which can be analyzed through a network approach. We have explored the temporal dynamics of individual-based plant networks resulting from pairwise similarities in pollinator composition. During two flowering seasons, we surveyed the phenology and pollinator fauna of the individual plants from a population of Erysimum mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae). We analyzed the topology of these networks by means of their modularity, clustering, and core-periphery structure. These metrics are related to network functional properties such as cohesion, transitivity and centralization respectively. Afterwards, we analyzed the influence of each pollinator functional group on network topology. We found that network topology varied widely over time as a consequence of the differences in plant phenology and the idiosyncratic and contextual effect of pollinators. When integrating all temporary networks, the network became cohesive (non modular), transitive (locally clusterized), and centralized (core-periphery topology). These topologies could entail important consequences for plant reproduction. Our results highlight the importance of considering the entire flowering season and the necessity of making comprehensive temporal sampling when trying to build reliable interaction networks.},

Here, we present a model framework for estimating the realized host breadth of dependent fauna from samples collected from replicate host individuals. We use Bayesian, Zero-inflated Poisson regression to model the abundance conditional upon host use – our focal parameter. We illustrate the model using a data set of insects on threatened and non-threatened plant species from eastern Australia. Estimating co-extinction risk through threats to host organisms is a key application for the model, requiring assessment of the host-specificity of biota, whilst incorporating uncertainty. 3. The host breadth model indicated that several insect species had high probability of narrow host breadth, including several species that appeared to only have one host. Furthermore, the model distinguished polyphagous, oligophagous and monophagous insect species. Modification of the model to account for false positives also identified tourist occurrences. 4. The host breadth model can be utilized not only towards focusing conservation actions on the most co-threatened dependent invertebrate species, but also for other projects involving host-specificity, such as estimating the number of insects globally, and selecting the most likely candidates for biological control of invasive species. Further uses are likely in various data sets of associations between species.},

  Abstract                 = {Extensive land-use change in the tropics has produced a mosaic of successional forests within an agricultural and cattle-pasture matrix. Post-disturbance biodiversity assessments have found that regeneration speed depends upon propagule availability and the intensity and duration of disturbance. However, reestablishment of species interactions is still poorly understood and this limits our understanding of the anthropogenic impacts upon ecosystem resilience. This is the first investigation that evaluates plant-herbivore interaction networks during secondary succession. In particular we investigated succession in a Mexican tropical dry forest using data of caterpillar associations with plants during 2007-2010. Plant-herbivore networks showed high resilience. We found no differences in most network descriptors between secondary and mature forest and only recently abandoned fields were found to be different. No significant nestedness or modularity network structure was found. Plant-herbivore network properties appear to quickly reestablish after perturbation, despite differences in species richness and composition. This study provides some valuable guidelines for the implement of restoration efforts that can enhance ecological processes such as the interaction between plants and their herbivores.},

  abstractnote = {Virtually all empirical ecological interaction networks to some extent suffer from undersampling. However, how limitations imposed by sampling incompleteness affect our understanding of ecological networks is still poorly explored, which may hinder further advances in the field. Here, we use a plant-hummingbird network with unprecedented sampling effort (2,716 hours of focal observations) from the Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil, to investigate how sampling effort affects the description of network structure (i.e. widely used network metrics) and the relative importance of distinct processes (i.e. species abundances vs traits) in determining the frequency of pairwise interactions. By dividing the network into time slices representing a gradient of sampling effort, we show that quantitative metrics, such as interaction evenness, specialization (H2 ’), weighted nestedness (wNODF) and modularity (Q; QuanBiMo algorithm), were less biased by sampling incompleteness than binary metrics. Furthermore, the significance of some network metrics changed along the sampling effort gradient. Nevertheless, the higher importance of traits in structuring the network was apparent even with small sampling effort. Our results (i) warn against using very poorly sampled networks as this may bias our understanding of networks, both their patterns and structuring processes, (ii) encourage the use of quantitative metrics little influenced by sampling when performing spatio-temporal comparisons, and (iii) indicate that in networks strongly constrained by species traits, such as plant-hummingbird networks, even small sampling is sufficient to detect their relative importance for the structure of interactions. Finally, we argue that similar effects of sampling are expected for other highly specialized subnetworks. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

  Abstract                 = {Theory has long predicted that insect community structure should be related to host plant phylogeny. We examined the distribution of insect herbivore associations with respect to host plant phylogeny for caterpillars (Lepidoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), and grasshoppers and relatives (orthopteroids) in a New Guinea rain forest. We collected herbivores from three lineages of closely related woody plants and from more distantly related plant lineages in the same locality to examine the phylogenetic scale at which host specificity can be detected in a community sample. By grafting molecular phylogenies inferred from three different genes into a supertree, we developed a phylogenetic hypothesis for the host community. Feeding experiments were performed on more than 100 000 live insects collected from the 62 host species. We examined patterns of host use with respect to the host plant phylogeny. As predicted, we found a negative relationship between faunal similarity, defined as the proportion of all herbivores feeding on two hosts that are shared between the hosts, and the phylogenetic distance between hosts based on DNA sequence divergence. Host phylogenetic distance explained a significant fraction of the variance (25{\%}) in herbivore community similarity, in spite of the many ecological factors that probably influence feeding patterns. Herbivore community similarity among congeneric hosts was high (50{\%} on average) compared to overlap among host families (20-30{\%} on average). We confirmed this pattern using the nearest taxon index (NTI) and net relatedness index (NRI) to quantify the extent of phylogenetic clustering in particular herbivore associations and to test whether patterns are significantly different from chance expectations. We found that 40{\%} of caterpillar species showed significant phylogenetic clustering with respect to host plant associations, somewhat more so than for beetles or orthopteroids. We interpret this as evidence that a substantial fraction of tropical forest insect herbivores are clade specialists.},

  Abstract                 = {The distribution of the number of links per species, or degree distribution, is widely used as a summary of the topology of complex networks. Degree distributions have been studied in a range of ecological networks, including both mutualistic bipartite networks of plants and pollinators or seed dispersers and antagonistic bipartite networks of plants and their consumers. The shape of a degree distribution, for example whether it follows an exponential or power-law form, is typically taken to be indicative of the processes structuring the network. The skewed degree distributions of bipartite mutualistic and antagonistic networks are usually assumed to show that ecological or co-evolutionary processes constrain the relative numbers of specialists and generalists in the network. I show that a simple null model based on the principle of maximum entropy cannot be rejected as a model for the degree distributions in most of the 115 bipartite ecological networks tested here. The model requires knowledge of the number of nodes and links in the network, but needs no other ecological information. The model cannot be rejected for 159 (69{\%}) of the 230 degree distributions of the 115 networks tested. It performed equally well on the plant and animal degree distributions, and cannot be rejected for 81 (70{\%}) of the 115 plant distributions and 78 (68{\%}) of the animal distributions. There are consistent differences between the degree distributions of mutualistic and antagonistic networks, suggesting that different processes are constraining these two classes of networks. Fit to the MaxEnt null model is consistently poor among the largest mutualistic networks. Potential ecological and methodological explanations for deviations from the model suggest that spatial and temporal heterogeneity are important drivers of the structure of these large networks.},

Early mechanism-based theory asserted that food webs have little omnivory and several properties that are independent of species richness. This theory was overturned by empirical studies that found food webs to be much more complex, but these studies did not provide mechanisticrnexplanations for the complexity. Here we show that a remarkably simple model fills this scientific void by successfullyrnpredicting key structural properties of the most complex and comprehensive food webs in the primary literature. These properties include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and basal trophic levels, the means and variabilities of generality, vulnerability and food-chain length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and trophic similarity. Using only two empirical parameters, species number and connectance, our `niche model’ extends the existing `cascade model’ and improves its fit ten-fold by constraining species to consume a contiguous sequence of prey in a one-dimensional trophic niche.},

  abstract      = {The relationship between food web complexity and stability has been the subject of a long-standing debate in ecology. Although rapid changes in the food web structure through adaptive foraging behavior can confer stability to complex food webs, as reported by Kondoh (Science 299:1388‚Äì1391, 2003), the exact mechanisms behind this adaptation have not been specified in previous studies; thus, the applicability of such predictions to real ecosystems remains unclear. One mechanism of adaptive foraging is evolutionary change in genetically determined prey use. We constructed individual-based models of evolution of prey use by predators assuming explicit pop- ulation genetics processes, and examined how this evolu- tion affects the stability (i.e., the proportion of species that persist) of the food web and whether the complexity of the food web increased the stability of the prey‚Äìpredator sys- tem. The analysis showed that the stability of food webs decreased with increasing complexity regardless of evolu- tion of prey use by predators. The effects of evolution on stability differed depending on the assumptions made regarding genetic control of prey use. The probabilities of species extinctions were associated with the establishment or loss of trophic interactions via evolution of the predator, indicating a clear link between structural changes in the food web and community stability.},

The information contained in such interac-tion matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exemplified here by modu-larity, is difficult to link to specific causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to specific interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substan-tial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on fitness consequences as measured in exper-imental setups.},

In particular " classical " one-mode (" unipartite ") food webs and bipartite (two-mode) interaction networks are two very active research fields. While often aiming to tackle similar topics (such as community stabil-ity and species coexistence) their data, methods and approaches often differ substantially. In this chapter we shall review the continuum of food web approaches along a set of questions: • Which kind of data form the basis of the network? Are interactions observed or inferred? • What do network nodes and links represent? • What is the focus of scientific questions, which key features and topics are being investigated? • Which methods are employed, and what are their potential pitfalls? We find that the literature on food webs and bipartite networks reveals very different challenges, alt-hough the questions addressed are often very similar. For example, sampling artifacts and ecological interpretation of link strength are issues of vigorous discussion in many studies of bipartite networks, while being accepted largely unquestioned in classical food webs. In contrast, dynamic analyses and their mathematical challenges are behind many food webs papers, while being marginal to bipartite network research. In fact, several substantial criticisms leveled at one type of network are absent from the other for purely historic reasons.
